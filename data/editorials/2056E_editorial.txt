Hints
Hint 1
Forget about counting. What is the maximum size of $$$T$$$ if $$$m = 0$$$?
Hint 2
It is $$$2n - 1$$$. What if $$$m$$$ isn't $$$0$$$?
Hint 3
It is still $$$2n - 1$$$. To prove this represent a
good
set as a forest.
Hint 4
We can always add $$$[1, n]$$$ and $$$[i, i]$$$ for all $$$1 \le i \le n$$$ to $$$S$$$. Now the tree of $$$S$$$ has exactly $$$n$$$ leaves. What if a vertex has more than $$$2$$$ children?
Hint 5
What is the number of solutions when $$$m = 0$$$?
Hint 6
It is the number of full binary trees with $$$n$$$ leaves, which is $$$C_{n - 1}$$$, where $$$C$$$ denotes the Catalan's sequence. Extend this idea to count the number of solutions for a general tree of $$$S$$$.

Section 2:
Solution
Any
good
set has a tree-like structure.
Specifically, represent $$$S$$$ as a forest the following way: segment $$$[l, r]$$$ has a parent $$$[L, R]$$$ iff $$$[l, r] \in [L, R]$$$ and $$$R - L + 1$$$ is minimized (its parent is the shortest interval in which it lies). This segment is unique (or does not exist), because there can't be two segments with minimum length that cover $$$[l, r]$$$, as they would partially intersect otherwise.
Notice that we can always add $$$[1, n]$$$ and $$$[i, i]$$$ for all $$$1 \le i \le n$$$ if they aren't in $$$S$$$ yet. Now the forest of $$$S$$$ is a tree with exactly $$$n$$$ leaves.
Suppose $$$[L, R]$$$ has $$$k$$$ children $$$[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \ldots, [l_k, r_k]$$$. If $$$k > 2$$$, we can always add $$$[l_1, r_2]$$$ to $$$S$$$, which decreases the number of children of $$$[L, R]$$$ by $$$1$$$ and increases the size of $$$S$$$ by $$$1$$$.
Therefore, in the optimal solution each segment has at most $$$2$$$ children. Having exactly one child is impossible, as we have added all $$$[i, i]$$$, so every index of $$$[L, R]$$$ is covered by its children.
This means that we have a tree where each vertex has either $$$0$$$ or $$$2$$$ children, which is a full binary tree.
We have $$$n$$$ leaves, and every full binary tree with $$$n$$$ leaves has exactly $$$2n - 1$$$ vertices, so this is always the optimal size of $$$T$$$ regardless of $$$S$$$.
To count the number of $$$T$$$, notice that when $$$m = 0$$$ the answer is the number of full binary trees with $$$n$$$ leaves, which is $$$C_{n - 1}$$$, where $$$C$$$ denotes the Catalan's sequence.
To extend this to a general tree, we can add $$$[1, n]$$$ and $$$[i, i]$$$ for all $$$1 \le i \le n$$$ to $$$S$$$.
Now suppose $$$[L, R]$$$ has $$$k \ge 2$$$ children $$$[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \ldots, [l_k, r_k]$$$. We need to merge some children. We can treat $$$[l_1, r_1]$$$ as $$$[1, 1]$$$, $$$[l_2, r_2]$$$ as $$$[2, 2]$$$, etc. This is now the same case as $$$m = 0$$$, so there are $$$C_{k - 1}$$$ ways to merge children of $$$[L, R]$$$.
Each vertex is independent of each other, so the answer is $$$\prod C_{c_v - 1}$$$ over all non-leaves $$$v$$$, where $$$c_v$$$ is the number of children of $$$v$$$.
We can construct the tree in $$$O(n \log n)$$$ by definition or in $$$O(n)$$$ using a stack.
