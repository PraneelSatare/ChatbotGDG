Section 1:
Hint 1
What is the size of the maximum possible matching? What can be the "most dense" graph with maximum matching $$$k$$$?

Section 2:
Hint 2
Mixed-color triplet($$$u, v$$$ with edge $$$0$$$ and $$$v, w$$$ with edge $$$1$$$) is a flexible structure to find a matching for both types.

Section 3:
Hint 3
Add vertices one by one. Try to get a "mixed-color triple" or a larger set of the same color.
