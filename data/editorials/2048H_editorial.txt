2048H - Kevin and Strange Operation
Assume that after performing several operations on the $$$01$$$ string $$$s$$$, we get the $$$01$$$ string $$$t$$$. Itâ€™s not hard to notice that each element in $$$t$$$ corresponds to the $$$\max$$$ of a subset of elements from $$$s$$$. Further observation shows that this subset must form a continuous segment, so we can express $$$t_i$$$ as $$$\max\limits_{k=l_i}^{r_i} s_k$$$.
Initially, $$$t = s$$$, so all $$$l_i = r_i = i$$$. Suppose the current length of string $$$t$$$ is $$$m$$$, corresponding to two sequences $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$. If an operation is performed at position $$$p$$$ where $$$1 \le p \le m$$$, the new sequence $$$t'$$$ will correspond to two sequences $$$l'$$$ and $$$r'$$$. Then, since for $$$1 \le i < p$$$, we have $$$t'_i=\max(t_i,t_{i+1})$$$, and for $$$p \le i < m$$$, $$$t'_i=t_{i+1}$$$, it can be observed that for $$$1 \le i < p$$$, we have $$$l'_i=l_i,r'_i=r_{i+1}$$$, and for $$$p \le i < m$$$, $$$l'_i=l_{i+1},r'_i=r_{i+1}$$$. If we only focus on the change of sequences $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ to $$$l'$$$ and $$$r'$$$, it is equivalent to deleting the values $$$l_p$$$ and $$$r_1$$$.
Thus, performing $$$k$$$ operations starting from the sequence $$$s$$$, the resulting sequence $$$t$$$ will correspond to the sequences $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, where $$$l$$$ is obtained by deleting any $$$k$$$ values from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, and $$$r$$$ is the sequence from $$$k+1$$$ to $$$n$$$.
Now, let's consider how to determine if the $$$01$$$ string $$$t$$$ can be generated. By reversing $$$t$$$ to get $$$t'$$$, the task becomes finding $$$n \ge p_1 > p_2 > \dots > p_k \ge 1$$$ such that for all $$$1 \le i \le k$$$, we have $$$t'_i=\max\limits_{k=p_i}^{n-i+1}s_k$$$. A clearly correct greedy strategy is to choose $$$p_i$$$ in the order $$$i=1 \sim k$$$, always selecting the largest possible value.
Now consider performing DP. Let $$$dp_{i,j}$$$ represent how many length-$$$i$$$ $$$01$$$ strings $$$t$$$ can be generated such that after running the above greedy algorithm, $$$p_i$$$ exactly equals $$$j$$$. We assume that $$$p_0 = n+1$$$ and the boundary condition is $$$dp_{0,n+1} = 1$$$. We now consider the transition from $$$dp_{i-1,j}$$$ to $$$dp_{i,*}$$$:
If $$$s[j-1, n-i+1]$$$ already contains $$$1$$$, then the $$$i$$$-th position in the reversed $$$t$$$ must be $$$1$$$, and it must be the case that $$$p_i = j-1$$$, so we add $$$dp_{i,j-1}$$$ to $$$dp_{i-1,j}$$$.
If $$$s[j-1, n-i+1]$$$ does not contain $$$1$$$, the $$$i$$$-th position in the reversed $$$t$$$ can be $$$0$$$. If it is $$$0$$$, then it must be the case that $$$p_i = j-1$$$, and we add $$$dp_{i,j-1}$$$ to $$$dp_{i-1,j}$$$; if we want the $$$i$$$-th position in the reversed $$$t$$$ to be $$$1$$$, we need to find the largest $$$pos \le n-i+1$$$ such that $$$s_{pos} = 1$$$, and then set $$$p_i = pos$$$, adding $$$dp_{i,pos}$$$ to $$$dp_{i-1,j}$$$.
Both types of transitions can be considered as adding $$$dp_{i,j-1}$$$ to $$$dp_{i-1,j}$$$, then finding the largest $$$pos \le n-i+1$$$ where $$$s_{pos} = 1$$$, and for all $$$j-1 > pos$$$ (i.e., $$$j \ge pos+2$$$), adding $$$dp_{i,pos}$$$ to $$$dp_{i,j}$$$.
The first type of transition can be viewed as a global shift of the DP array, while the second type requires calculating a segment suffix sum of the DP array and then performing a point update. This can be done efficiently using a segment tree in $$$O(n \log n)$$$ time for all transitions.
The final answer is the sum of all $$$1 \le i \le n, 1 \le j \le n$$$ of $$$dp_{i,j}$$$. Using a segment tree for maintenance, we can also query the sum of each entry of $$$dp_i$$$ in $$$O(1)$$$ time (by setting to zero those entries where $$$dp_{i-1,1}$$$ is out of range after the shift).
Since the transitions have better properties, it's actually possible to solve the problem cleverly using prefix sums in $$$O(n)$$$ time without needing complex data structures, but that is not strictly necessary.
