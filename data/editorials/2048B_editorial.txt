2048B - Kevin and Permutation
In the entire permutation, at most $$$k$$$ subintervals can contain $$$1$$$. Similarly, at most $$$k$$$ subintervals can contain $$$2, 3, \ldots$$$. To maximize the number of subintervals where the minimum value is as small as possible, we use the following construction:
$$$ p_k=1,p_{2k}=2,\dots,p_{\lfloor{\frac{n}{k}}\rfloor\cdot k}=\left\lfloor\frac{n}{k}\right\rfloor $$$
For the remaining positions, we can fill them arbitrarily with all values from $$$\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor + 1$$$ to $$$n$$$. It is easy to prove that this construction minimizes the answer.
