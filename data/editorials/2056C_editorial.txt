Hints
Hint 1
Analyze the example with $$$n = 6$$$.
Hint 2
If $$$[a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k, a_{n - k + 1}, a_{n - k + 2}, \ldots, a_n]$$$ is a palindrome, then $$$[a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k, a_i, a_{n - k + 1}, a_{n - k + 2}, \ldots, a_n]$$$ is also a palindrome for all $$$k < i < n - k + 1$$$.

Section 2:
Solution
If $$$[a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k, a_{n - k + 1}, a_{n - k + 2}, \ldots, a_n]$$$ is a palindrome, then $$$[a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k, a_i, a_{n - k + 1}, a_{n - k + 2}, \ldots, a_n]$$$ is also a palindrome for all $$$k < i < n - k + 1$$$, because we make it's length odd and add $$$a_i$$$ to the middle.
We can use this to create a sequence with a big value of $$$g$$$. However, we shouldn't create a palindrome of a greater length than $$$2k + 1$$$ by using the fact above.
That make us try something like $$$a = [1, 2, 3, \ldots, n - 2, 1, 2]$$$. $$$f(a) = 3$$$ here, and any of $$$[a_1, a_i, a_{n - 1}]$$$ for $$$1 < i < n - 1$$$ and $$$[a_2, a_i, a_n]$$$ for $$$2 < i < n$$$ are palindromes, which means that $$$g(a) = 2(n - 3) = 2n - 6$$$.
This construction works for $$$n \ge 7$$$, so we have to handle $$$n = 6$$$ separately.
We can also use the construction from the example with $$$n = 6$$$ directly: $$$a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots, n - 3, 1, 2]$$$, which has $$$g(a) = 3n - 11$$$.
