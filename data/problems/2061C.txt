Kevin enjoys logic puzzles.
He played a game with $$$n$$$ classmates who stand in a line. The $$$i$$$-th person from the left says that there are $$$a_i$$$ liars to their left (not including themselves).
Each classmate is either honest or a liar, with the restriction that
no two liars can stand next to each other
. Honest classmates always say the truth.
Liars can say either the truth or lies
, meaning their statements are considered unreliable.
Kevin wants to determine the number of distinct possible game configurations modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$. Two configurations are considered different if at least one classmate is honest in one configuration and a liar in the other.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1\leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of classmates.
The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0\leq a_i \leq n$$$) — the number of liars to the left of the $$$i$$$-th person they claimed.
It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.
Output
For each test case, output one integer — the number of distinct game configurations modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

Note
We will use $$$\color{red}{\text{red}}$$$ to mark liars and $$$\color{blue}{\text{blue}}$$$ to mark honest people.
In the first test case, the only possible way is $$$(\color{red}{0},\color{blue}{1},\color{red}{2})$$$.
In the second test case, two possible ways are $$$(\color{blue}{0},\color{blue}{0},\color{blue}{0},\color{blue}{0},\color{blue}{0})$$$ and $$$(\color{blue}{0},\color{blue}{0},\color{blue}{0},\color{blue}{0},\color{red}{0})$$$.
In the third test case, three possible ways are $$$(\color{blue}{0},\color{blue}{0},\color{red}{1},\color{blue}{1},\color{red}{2})$$$, $$$(\color{blue}{0},\color{red}{0},\color{blue}{1},\color{red}{1},\color{blue}{2})$$$, $$$(\color{blue}{0},\color{red}{0},\color{blue}{1},\color{blue}{1},\color{red}{2})$$$.
