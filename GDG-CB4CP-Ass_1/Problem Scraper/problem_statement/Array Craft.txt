Statement:
For an array b of size m, we define:

- the maximum prefix position of b is the smallest index i that satisfies b_1+...+b_i=\max_{j=1}^{m}(b_1+...+b_j);
- the maximum suffix position of b is the largest index i that satisfies b_i+...+b_m=\max_{j=1}^{m}(b_j+...+b_m).
You are given three integers n, x, and y (x > y). Construct an array a of size n satisfying:

- a_i is either 1 or -1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n;
- the maximum prefix position of a is x;
- the maximum suffix position of a is y.
If there are multiple arrays that meet the conditions, print any. It can be proven that such an array always exists under the given conditions.

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤q t ≤q 10^4) — the number of test cases.

For each test case:

- The only line contains three integers n, x, and y (2 ≤q n ≤q 10^5, 1 ≤ y \lt x ≤ n).
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases will not exceed 10^5.

For each test case, output n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n in a new line.

In the second test case,

- i=x=4 is the smallest index that satisfies a_1+... +a_i=\max_{j=1}^{n}(a_1+...+a_j)=2;
- i=y=3 is the greatest index that satisfies a_i+... +a_n=\max_{j=1}^{n}(a_j+...+a_n)=2.
Thus, the array a=[1,-1,1,1] is considered correct.
