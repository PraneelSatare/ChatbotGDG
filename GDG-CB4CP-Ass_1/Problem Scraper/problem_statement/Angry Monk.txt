Statement:
To celebrate his recovery, k1o0n has baked an enormous n metres long potato casserole.

Turns out, Noobish_Monk just can't stand potatoes, so he decided to ruin k1o0n's meal. He has cut it into k pieces, of lengths a_1, a_2, .., a_k meters.

k1o0n wasn't keen on that. Luckily, everything can be fixed. In order to do that, k1o0n can do one of the following operations:

- Pick a piece with length a_i ≥ 2 and divide it into two pieces with lengths 1 and a_i - 1. As a result, the number of pieces will increase by 1;
- Pick a slice a_i and another slice with length a_j=1 (i ≠ j) and merge them into one piece with length a_i+1. As a result, the number of pieces will decrease by 1.
Help k1o0n to find the minimum number of operations he needs to do in order to merge the casserole into one piece with length n.

For example, if n=5, k=2 and a = [3, 2], it is optimal to do the following:

- Divide the piece with length 2 into two pieces with lengths 2-1=1 and 1, as a result a = [3, 1, 1].
- Merge the piece with length 3 and the piece with length 1, as a result a = [4, 1].
- Merge the piece with length 4 and the piece with length 1, as a result a = [5].
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

Description of each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — length of casserole and the number of pieces.

The second line contains k integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n - 1, ∑ a_i = n) — lengths of pieces of casserole, which Noobish_Monk has cut.

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all t test cases doesn't exceed 2 · 10^5.

For each test case, output the minimum number of operations K1o0n needs to restore his pie after the terror of Noobish_Monk.
