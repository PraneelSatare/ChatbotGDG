Statement:
Let D(n) represent the sum of digits of n. For how many integers n where 10^{l} ≤q n < 10^{r} satisfy D(k · n) = k · D(n)? Output the answer modulo 10^9+7.

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤q t ≤q 10^4) – the number of test cases.

Each test case contains three integers l, r, and k (0 ≤q l < r ≤q 10^9, 1 ≤q k ≤q 10^9).

For each test case, output an integer, the answer, modulo 10^9 + 7.

For the first test case, the only values of n that satisfy the condition are 1 and 2.

For the second test case, the only values of n that satisfy the condition are 1, 10, and 11.

For the third test case, all values of n between 10 inclusive and 100 exclusive satisfy the condition.
