Title: I1. Affectionate Arrays (Easy Version)
Time Limit: 3 seconds
Memory Limit: 512 megabytes

Problem Description:

This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, you need to compute the minimum length of the arrays. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem.
Iris treasures an integer arraya1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an. She knows this array has an interesting property: the maximum absolute value of all elements is less than or equal to the sum of all elements, that is,max(|ai|)≤∑aimax(|ai|)≤∑ai.
Iris defines theboredomof an array as its maximum subarray∗∗sum.
Iris's birthday is coming, and Victor is going to send her another arrayb1,b2,…,bmb1,b2,…,bmas a gift. For some seemingly obvious reasons, he decides the arrayb1,b2,…,bmb1,b2,…,bmshould have the following properties.
Even constrained as above, there are still too many possible gifts. So Victor asks you tocompute the value ofmmof any arrayb1,b2,…,bmb1,b2,…,bmsatisfying all the conditions above. He promises you: if you help him successfully, he will share a bit of Iris's birthday cake with you.
Note: since the input is large, you may need to optimize it for this problem.
For example, in C++, it is enough to use the following lines at the start of themain()function:
∗∗An arrayccis a subarray of an arrayddifcccan be obtained fromddby the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.
††A sequenceccis a subsequence of a sequenceddifcccan be obtained fromddby the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.

Input Specification:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains an integertt(1≤t≤1051≤t≤105) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integernn(1≤n≤3⋅1061≤n≤3⋅106) — the length of the arraya1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an.The second line of each test case containsnnintegersa1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an(−109≤ai≤109−109≤ai≤109) — the initial array. It is guaranteed thatmax(|ai|)≤∑aimax(|ai|)≤∑ai.It is guaranteed that the sum ofnnover all test cases does not exceed3⋅1063⋅106.

Output Specification:
For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the lengthmmof a valid arraybb.

Examples:
Example 1:
Input:
4
4
1 2 3 4
4
2 -3 2 2
10
2 -7 6 3 -1 4 2 -5 8 -4
20
4 -2 4 3 -2 1 5 2 3 6 -5 -1 -4 -2 -3 5 -3 1 -4 1
Output:
4
6
14
25

Note:
In the first test case,a=[1,2,3,4]a=[1,2,3,4]. The only arraybbwhich satisfies all the properties above is[1,2,3,4][1,2,3,4], so we should output44.In the second test case,a=[2,−3,2,2]a=[2,−3,2,2]. The possible arraysbbare[1,2,−3,2,−1,2][1,2,−3,2,−1,2]and[2,1,−3,2,−1,2][2,1,−3,2,−1,2], so we should output66.
