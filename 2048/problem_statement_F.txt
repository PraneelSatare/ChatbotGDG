Problem Statement
Kevin is a student from Eversleeping Town, currently attending a math class where the teacher is giving him division exercises.
On the board, there are two rows of positive integers written, each containing n numbers. The first row is a1,a2,…,an , and the second row is b1,b2,…,bn .
For each division exercise, Kevin can choose any segment [l,r] and find the smallest value x among bl,bl+1,…,br . He will then modify each ai for l≤i≤r to be the ceiling of ai divided by x .
Formally, he selects two integers 1≤l≤r≤n , sets x=minl≤i≤rbi , and changes all ai for l≤i≤r to ⌈ ai x ⌉ .
Kevin can leave class and go home when all ai become 1 . He is eager to leave and wants to know the minimum number of division exercises required to achieve this.

Input
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t ( 1≤t≤104 ).
The first line of each test case contains an integer n ( 1≤n≤2⋅105 ) — the length of the sequence a and b .
The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an ( 1≤ai≤1018 ) — the first row of integers on the board.
The third line of each test case contains n integers b1,b2,…,bn ( 2≤bi≤1018 ) — the second row of integers on the board.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅105 .

Output
Output
For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of division exercises required to leave class.

Example
[{'input': ['3', '5 4 2', '6 3 2'], 'output': '2'}, {'input': ['5', '3 6 1 3 2', '3 5 3 2 2'], 'output': '3'}, {'input': ['6', '8 3 3 7 5 8', '3 2 3 4 2 3'], 'output': '3'}]

Note
Note
For the first test case: [5,4,2] operate segment [1,2] → min(b1,b2)=3 [2,2,2] operate segment [1,3] → min(b1,b2,b3)=2 [1,1,1] .
For the second test case: [3,6,1,3,2] operate segment [1,3] → min(b1,b2,b3)=3 [1,2,1,3,2] operate segment [2,4] → min(b2,b3,b4)=2 [1,1,1,2,2] operate segment [4,5] → min(b4,b5)=2 [1,1,1,1,1] .
