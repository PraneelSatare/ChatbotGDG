Problem Statement
Kevin has been transported to Sacred Heart Hospital, which contains all the n×m matrices with integer values in the range [1,v] .
Now, Kevin wants to befriend some matrices, but he is willing to befriend a matrix a if and only if the following condition is satisfied:
min 1≤i≤n ( max 1≤j≤m ai,j)≤ max 1≤j≤m ( min 1≤i≤n ai,j).
Please count how many matrices in Sacred Heart Hospital can be friends with Kevin.
Since Kevin is very friendly, there could be many matrices that meet this condition. Therefore, you only need to output the result modulo 998244353 .

Input
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t ( 1≤t≤8⋅103 ).
The only line of each test case contains three integers n , m , v ( 1≤n,v,n⋅v≤106 , 1≤m≤109 ).
It is guaranteed that the sum of n⋅v over all test cases doesn't exceed 106 .

Output
Output
For each test case, output one integer — the number of matrices that can be friends with Kevin modulo 998244353 .

Example
[{'input': ['2 2 2'], 'output': '14'}, {'input': ['2 3 4'], 'output': '2824'}, {'input': ['11 45 14'], 'output': '883799966'}]

Note
Note
In the first test case, besides the matrices a=[ 1 2 2 1 ] and a=[ 2 1 1 2 ] , which do not satisfy the condition, the remaining 22⋅2−2=14 matrices can all be friends with Kevin.
