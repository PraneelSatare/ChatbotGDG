  "input": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 200$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 50$$$), the length of $$$a$$$.The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers, $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le 100$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$500$$$.",
