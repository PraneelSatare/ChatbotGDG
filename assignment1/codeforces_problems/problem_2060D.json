  "input": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows.The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).The second line of each test case contains $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "output": "OutputIf it is possible to make the sequence non-decreasing, print \"YES\" on a new line. Otherwise, print \"NO\" on a new line.You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", and \"Yes\" will also be recognized as positive responses.",
