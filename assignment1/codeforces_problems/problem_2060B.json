  "input": "InputThe first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 400$$$) — the number of test cases.The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\cdot m \\leq 2\\,000$$$) — the number of cows and the number of cards each cow receives.The following $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$m$$$ integers each – the cards received by each cow. It is guaranteed all given numbers (across all $$$n$$$ lines) are distinct and in the range from $$$0$$$ to $$$n \\cdot m - 1$$$, inclusive.It is guaranteed the sum of $$$n \\cdot m$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\,000$$$.",
  "output": "OutputFor each test case, output the following on a new line:  If $$$p$$$ exists, output $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$.  Otherwise, output $$$-1$$$.",
