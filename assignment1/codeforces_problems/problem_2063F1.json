  "input": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 5000$$$) — the number of good pairs.Then, each of the $$$n$$$ following lines contains two integers $$$l_i$$$ and $$$r_i$$$ representing the $$$i$$$-th clue ($$$1 \\le l_i < r_i \\le 2n$$$).The clues in one test case are pairwise distinct and do not contradict each other.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$.",
  "output": "OutputFor each test case, output $$$n+1$$$ integers on a separate line:   The first integer is the answer before all clues, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.  For all $$$i \\ge 1$$$, the $$$i+1$$$-th integer is the answer after the $$$i$$$-th clue, modulo $$$998\\,244\\,353$$$.",
