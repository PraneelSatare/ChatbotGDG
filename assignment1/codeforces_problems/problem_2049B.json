  "input": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 500$$$), the length of $$$s$$$.The second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ that consists of the characters p, s, and ..It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$5000$$$.",
  "output": "OutputFor each test case, output YES or NO on a line. Output YES if there is such a permutation and NO otherwise.You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.",
