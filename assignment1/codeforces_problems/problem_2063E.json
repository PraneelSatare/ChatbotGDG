  "input": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$).Each of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$u_i$$$ and $$$v_i$$$, denoting the two vertices connected by an edge ($$$1 \\le u_i,v_i \\le n$$$, $$$u_i \\neq v_i$$$).It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
