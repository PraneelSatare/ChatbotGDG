  "output": "OutputThe first line of the output should contain a single integer $$$m$$$ — the maximum possible number of overtakes that can occur during the race.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines should contain two integers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\le x, y \\le n$$$, $$$x \\ne y$$$) representing an overtake event, where car $$$x$$$ overtakes car $$$y$$$. This means that car $$$x$$$ was directly behind car $$$y$$$ and overtakes it. The overtakes must be listed in the order they occurred during the race.After all $$$m$$$ overtakes have occurred, the cars must arrive at the finish line in the order $$$c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n$$$. Note that any car $$$x$$$ should not overtake another car $$$y$$$ more than once.If there are multiple possible longest sequences of overtakes, output any of them.",
