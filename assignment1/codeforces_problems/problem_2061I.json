  "input": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of matches.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$-1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$).If $$$a_i = -1$$$, the $$$i$$$-th match is of Type 2. Otherwise, the $$$i$$$-th match is of Type 1, and $$$a_i$$$ represents the amount of time Kevin needs to spend to win this match.It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$3 \\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "output": "OutputFor each test case, output $$$n + 1$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th integer represents the minimum amount of time to win at least $$$i-1$$$ matches.",
