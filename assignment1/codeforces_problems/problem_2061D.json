  "input": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1\\leq m \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of $$$a$$$ and the length of $$$b$$$.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1\\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$).The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1\\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$).It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.",
  "output": "OutputFor each test case, output \"Yes\" if it is possible to transform $$$a$$$ into $$$b$$$, and \"No\" otherwise.You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.",
