  "input": "InputEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 100$$$). The description of the test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$\\color{red}{6} \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the sequence.Note that there are no constraints on the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases.",
  "output": "OutputFor each test case, output $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$, representing an array that satisfies the conditions.If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them.",
