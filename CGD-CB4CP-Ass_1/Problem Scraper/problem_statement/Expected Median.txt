Statement:
Arul has a binary array∗ a of length n.

He will take all subsequences^{\text{†}} of length k (k is odd) of this array and find their median.^{\text{‡}}

What is the sum of all these values?

As this sum can be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7. In other words, print the remainder of this sum when divided by 10^9 + 7.

∗A binary array is an array consisting only of zeros and ones.

^{\text{†}}An array b is a subsequence of an array a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. Subsequences don't have to be contiguous.

^{\text{‡}}The median of an array of odd length k is the \frac{k+1}{2}-th element when sorted.

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤q t ≤q 10^4) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 ≤q k ≤q n ≤q 2 · 10^5, k is odd ) — the length of the array and the length of the subsequence, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (0 ≤q a_i ≤q 1) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

For each test case, print the sum modulo 10^9 + 7.

In the first test case, there are four subsequences of [1,0,0,1] with length k=3:

- [1,0,0]: median = 0.
- [1,0,1]: median = 1.
- [1,0,1]: median = 1.
- [0,0,1]: median = 0.
In the second test case, all subsequences of length 1 have median 1, so the answer is 5.
