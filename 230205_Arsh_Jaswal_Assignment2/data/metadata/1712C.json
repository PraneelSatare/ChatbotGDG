    "description": "You are given an array of n positive integers a1,a2,…,an. \nIn one operation you do the following: \nFind the minimum number of operations required to sort the array in non-decreasing order.\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤104). Description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤105).\nThe second line of each test case contains n positive integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤n).\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 105.\nFor each test case print one integer — the minimum number of operations required to sort the array in non-decreasing order.\nIn the first test case, you can choose x=3 for the operation, the resulting array is [0,0,2].\nIn the second test case, you can choose x=1 for the first operation and x=3 for the second operation, the resulting array is [0,0,0,0].",
