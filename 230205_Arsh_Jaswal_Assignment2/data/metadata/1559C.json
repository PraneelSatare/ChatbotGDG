    "description": "The city where Mocha lives in is called Zhijiang. There are n+1 villages and 2n−1 directed roads in this city. \nThere are two kinds of roads:\nMocha plans to go hiking with Taki this weekend. To avoid the trip being boring, they plan to go through every village exactly once. They can start and finish at any villages. Can you help them to draw up a plan? \nEach test contains multiple test cases. \nThe first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤20) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤104) — indicates that the number of villages is n+1.\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (0≤ai≤1). If ai=0, it means that there is a road from village i to village n+1. If ai=1, it means that there is a road from village n+1 to village i.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 104.\nFor each test case, print a line with n+1 integers, where the i-th number is the i-th village they will go through. If the answer doesn't exist, print −1.\nIf there are multiple correct answers, you can print any one of them.\nIn the first test case, the city looks like the following graph:\n\nSo all possible answers are (1→4→2→3), (1→2→3→4).\nIn the second test case, the city looks like the following graph:\n\nSo all possible answers are (4→1→2→3), (1→2→3→4), (3→4→1→2), (2→3→4→1).",
