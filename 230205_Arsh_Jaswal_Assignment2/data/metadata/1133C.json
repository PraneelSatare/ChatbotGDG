    "description": "You are a coach at your local university. There are n students under your supervision, the programming skill of the i-th student is ai.\nYou have to create a team for a new programming competition. As you know, the more students some team has the more probable its victory is! So you have to create a team with the maximum number of students. But you also know that a team should be balanced. It means that the programming skill of each pair of students in a created team should differ by no more than 5.\nYour task is to report the maximum possible number of students in a balanced team.\nThe first line of the input contains one integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of students.\nThe second line of the input contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109), where ai is a programming skill of the i-th student.\nPrint one integer — the maximum possible number of students in a balanced team.\nIn the first example you can create a team with skills [12,17,15].\nIn the second example you can take all students in a team because their programming skills are equal.\nIn the third example you can create a team consisting of a single student (and you cannot create a team consisting of at least two students).",
