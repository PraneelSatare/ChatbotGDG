    "description": "You have array of n numbers a1,a2,…,an. \nRearrange these numbers to satisfy |a1−a2|≤|a2−a3|≤…≤|an−1−an|, where |x| denotes absolute value of x. It's always possible to find such rearrangement.\nNote that all numbers in a are not necessarily different. In other words, some numbers of a may be same.\nYou have to answer independent t test cases.\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains single integer n (3≤n≤105) — the length of array a. It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases in the input does not exceed 105.\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (−109≤ai≤109).\nFor each test case, print the rearranged version of array a which satisfies given condition. If there are multiple valid rearrangements, print any of them.\nIn the first test case, after given rearrangement, |a1−a2|=0≤|a2−a3|=1≤|a3−a4|=2≤|a4−a5|=2≤|a5−a6|=10. There are other possible answers like \"5 4 5 6 -2 8\".\nIn the second test case, after given rearrangement, |a1−a2|=1≤|a2−a3|=2≤|a3−a4|=4. There are other possible answers like \"2 4 8 1\".",
