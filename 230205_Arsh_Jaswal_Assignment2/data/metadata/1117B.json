    "description": "There are n emotes in very popular digital collectible card game (the game is pretty famous so we won't say its name). The i-th emote increases the opponent's happiness by ai units (we all know that emotes in this game are used to make opponents happy).\nYou have time to use some emotes only m times. You are allowed to use any emotion once, more than once, or not use it at all. The only restriction is that you cannot use the same emote more than k times in a row (otherwise the opponent will think that you're trolling him).\nNote that two emotes i and j (i≠j) such that ai=aj are considered different.\nYou have to make your opponent as happy as possible. Find the maximum possible opponent's happiness.\nThe first line of the input contains three integers n,m and k (2≤n≤2⋅105, 1≤k≤m≤2⋅109) — the number of emotes, the number of times you can use emotes and the maximum number of times you may use the same emote in a row.\nThe second line of the input contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109), where ai is value of the happiness of the i-th emote.\nPrint one integer — the maximum opponent's happiness if you use emotes in a way satisfying the problem statement.\nIn the first example you may use emotes in the following sequence: 4,4,5,4,4,5,4,4,5.",
