    "description": "Vasya has n burles. One bottle of Ber-Cola costs a burles and one Bars bar costs b burles. He can buy any non-negative integer number of bottles of Ber-Cola and any non-negative integer number of Bars bars.\nFind out if it's possible to buy some amount of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars and spend exactly n burles.\nIn other words, you should find two non-negative integers x and y such that Vasya can buy x bottles of Ber-Cola and y Bars bars and x·a + y·b = n or tell that it's impossible.\nFirst line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10 000 000) — amount of money, that Vasya has.\nSecond line contains single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 10 000 000) — cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola.\nThird line contains single integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 10 000 000) — cost of one Bars bar.\nIf Vasya can't buy Bars and Ber-Cola in such a way to spend exactly n burles print «NO» (without quotes).\nOtherwise in first line print «YES» (without quotes). In second line print two non-negative integers x and y — number of bottles of Ber-Cola and number of Bars bars Vasya should buy in order to spend exactly n burles, i.e. x·a + y·b = n. If there are multiple answers print any of them.\nAny of numbers x and y can be equal 0.\nIn first example Vasya can buy two bottles of Ber-Cola and one Bars bar. He will spend exactly 2·2 + 1·3 = 7 burles.\nIn second example Vasya can spend exactly n burles multiple ways: \nIn third example it's impossible to but Ber-Cola and Bars bars in order to spend exactly n burles.",
