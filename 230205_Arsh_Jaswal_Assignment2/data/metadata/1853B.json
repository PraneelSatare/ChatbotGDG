    "description": "Ntarsis has received two integers n and k for his birthday. He wonders how many fibonacci-like sequences of length k can be formed with n as the k-th element of the sequence. \nA sequence of non-decreasing non-negative integers is considered fibonacci-like if fi=fi−1+fi−2 for all i>2, where fi denotes the i-th element in the sequence. Note that f1 and f2 can be arbitrary.\nFor example, sequences such as [4,5,9,14] and [0,1,1] are considered fibonacci-like sequences, while [0,0,0,1,1], [1,2,1,3], and [−1,−1,−2] are not: the first two do not always satisfy fi=fi−1+fi−2, the latter does not satisfy that the elements are non-negative.\nImpress Ntarsis by helping him with this task.\nThe first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤2⋅105), the number of test cases. The description of each test case is as follows.\nEach test case contains two integers, n and k (1≤n≤2⋅105, 3≤k≤109).\nIt is guaranteed the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each test case output an integer, the number of fibonacci-like sequences of length k such that the k-th element in the sequence is n. That is, output the number of sequences f of length k so f is a fibonacci-like sequence and fk=n. It can be shown this number is finite.\nThere are 4 valid fibonacci-like sequences for n=22, k=4:\nFor n=3, k=9, it can be shown that there are no fibonacci-like sequences satisfying the given conditions.\nFor n=55, k=11, [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55] is the only fibonacci-like sequence.",
