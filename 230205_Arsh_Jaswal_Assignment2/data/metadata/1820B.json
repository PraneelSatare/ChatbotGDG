Let's build a square table of size n×n, consisting of 0 and 1 characters as follows.\nIn the first row of the table write the original string s. In the second row of the table write cyclic shift of the string s by one to the right. In the third row of the table, write the cyclic shift of line s by two to the right. And so on. Thus, the row with number k will contain a cyclic shift of string s by k to the right. The rows are numbered from 0 to n−1 top-to-bottom.\nIn the resulting table we need to find the rectangle consisting only of ones that has the largest area.\nWe call a rectangle the set of all cells (i,j) in the table, such that x1≤i≤x2 and y1≤j≤y2 for some integers 0≤x1≤x2<n and 0≤y1≤y2<n.\nRecall that the cyclic shift of string s by k to the right is the string sn−k+1…sns1s2…sn−k. For example, the cyclic shift of the string \"01011\" by 0 to the right is the string itself \"01011\", its cyclic shift by 3 to the right is the string \"01101\".\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤2⋅104) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\nThe first and the only line of each test case contains a single binary string s (1≤|s|≤2⋅105), consisting of characters 0 and 1.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of string lengths |s| over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum area of a rectangle consisting only of ones. If there is no such rectangle, output 0.\nIn the first test case, there is a table 1×1 consisting of a single character 0, so there are no rectangles consisting of ones, and the answer is 0.\nIn the second test case, there is a table 1×1, consisting of a single character 1, so the answer is 1.\nIn the third test case, there is a table:\nIn the fourth test case, there is a table:\nIn the fifth test case, there is a table:\nRectangles with maximum area are shown in bold.",
