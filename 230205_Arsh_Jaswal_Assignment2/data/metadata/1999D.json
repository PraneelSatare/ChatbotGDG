    "description": "Slavic has a very tough exam and needs your help in order to pass it. Here is the question he is struggling with:\nThere exists a string s, which consists of lowercase English letters and possibly zero or more \"?\". \nSlavic is asked to change each \"?\" to a lowercase English letter such that string t becomes a subsequence (not necessarily continuous) of the string s. \nOutput any such string, or say that it is impossible in case no string that respects the conditions exists.\nThe first line contains a single integer T (1≤T≤104) — the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single string s (1≤|s|≤2⋅105, and s consists only of lowercase English letters and \"?\"-s)  – the original string you have.\nThe second line of each test case contains a single string t (1≤|t|≤|s|, and t consists only of lowercase English letters)  – the string that should be a subsequence of string s.\nThe sum of |s| over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅105, where |x| denotes the length of the string x.\nFor each test case, if no such string exists as described in the statement, output \"NO\" (without quotes).\nOtherwise, output \"YES\" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string that respects all conditions.\nYou can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", and \"Yes\" will be recognized as a positive response).\nIf multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.",
