    "description": "You are given an array of integers a1,a2,…,an. Find the maximum possible value of aiajakalat among all five indices (i,j,k,l,t) (i<j<k<l<t).\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤2⋅104) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (5≤n≤105) — the size of the array.\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (−3×103≤ai≤3×103) — given array.\nIt's guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.\nIn the first test case, choosing a1,a2,a3,a4,a5 is a best choice: (−1)⋅(−2)⋅(−3)⋅(−4)⋅(−5)=−120.\nIn the second test case, choosing a1,a2,a3,a5,a6 is a best choice: (−1)⋅(−2)⋅(−3)⋅2⋅(−1)=12.\nIn the third test case, choosing a1,a2,a3,a4,a5 is a best choice: (−1)⋅0⋅0⋅0⋅(−1)=0.\nIn the fourth test case, choosing a1,a2,a3,a4,a6 is a best choice: (−9)⋅(−7)⋅(−5)⋅(−3)⋅1=945.",
