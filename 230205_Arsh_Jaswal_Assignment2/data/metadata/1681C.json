    "description": "You are given two arrays a and b, both consisting of n integers.\nIn one move, you can choose two indices i and j (1≤i,j≤n; i≠j) and swap ai with aj and bi with bj. You have to perform the swap in both arrays.\nYou are allowed to perform at most 104 moves (possibly, zero). Can you make both arrays sorted in a non-decreasing order at the end? If you can, print any sequence of moves that makes both arrays sorted.\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of testcases.\nThe first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (2≤n≤100) — the number of elements in both arrays.\nThe second line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤n) — the first array.\nThe third line contains n integers b1,b2,…,bn (1≤bi≤n) — the second array.\nFor each testcase, print the answer. If it's impossible to make both arrays sorted in a non-decreasing order in at most 104 moves, print -1. Otherwise, first, print the number of moves k (0≤k≤104). Then print i and j for each move (1≤i,j≤n; i≠j).\nIf there are multiple answers, then print any of them. You don't have to minimize the number of moves.",
