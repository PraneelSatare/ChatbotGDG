    "description": "Hooray! Polycarp turned n years old! The Technocup Team sincerely congratulates Polycarp!\nPolycarp celebrated all of his n birthdays: from the 1-th to the n-th. At the moment, he is wondering: how many times he turned beautiful number of years?\nAccording to Polycarp, a positive integer is beautiful if it consists of only one digit repeated one or more times. For example, the following numbers are beautiful: 1, 77, 777, 44 and 999999. The following numbers are not beautiful: 12, 11110, 6969 and 987654321.\nOf course, Polycarpus uses the decimal numeral system (i.e. radix is 10).\nHelp Polycarpus to find the number of numbers from 1 to n (inclusive) that are beautiful.\nThe first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t test cases follow.\nEach test case consists of one line, which contains a positive integer n (1≤n≤109) — how many years Polycarp has turned.\nPrint t integers — the answers to the given test cases in the order they are written in the test. Each answer is an integer: the number of beautiful years between 1 and n, inclusive.\nIn the first test case of the example beautiful years are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11.",
