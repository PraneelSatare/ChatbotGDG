    "description": "You are given an array a of length n. In one operation, you can pick an index i from 2 to n−1 inclusive, and do one of the following actions:\n \nAfter each operation, all the values must be non-negative. Can you make all the elements equal after any number of operations?\nFirst line of input consists of one integer t (1≤t≤104)  — the number of test cases.\nFirst line of each test case consists of one integer n (3≤n≤2⋅105).\nSecond line of each test case consists of n integers ai (1≤ai≤109).\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n of all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" without quotation marks if it is possible to make all the elements equal after any number of operations; otherwise, print \"NO\" without quotation marks.\nYou can print answers in any register: \"yes\", \"YeS\", \"nO\"  — will also be considered correct.",
