    "description": "You are given a string s consisting of the characters '0', '1', and '?'. You need to replace all the characters with '?' in the string s by '0' or '1' so that the string becomes a palindrome and has exactly a characters '0' and exactly b characters '1'. Note that each of the characters '?' is replaced independently from the others.\nA string t of length n is called a palindrome if the equality t[i]=t[n−i+1] is true for all i (1≤i≤n).\nFor example, if s=\"01?????0\", a=4 and b=4, then you can replace the characters '?' in the following ways: \nFor the given string s and the numbers a and b, replace all the characters with '?' in the string s by '0' or '1' so that the string becomes a palindrome and has exactly a characters '0' and exactly b characters '1'.\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104). Then t test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers a and b (0≤a,b≤2⋅105, a+b≥1).\nThe second line of each test case contains the string s of length a+b, consisting of the characters '0', '1', and '?'.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the string lengths of s over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each test case, output: \nIf there are several suitable ways to replace characters, you can output any.",
