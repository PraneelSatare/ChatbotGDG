    "description": "You are given two integers n and k.\nYou should create an array of n positive integers a1,a2,…,an such that the sum (a1+a2+⋯+an) is divisible by k and maximum element in a is minimum possible.\nWhat is the minimum possible maximum element in a?\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1≤n≤109; 1≤k≤109).\nFor each test case, print one integer — the minimum possible maximum element in array a such that the sum (a1+⋯+an) is divisible by k. \nIn the first test case n=1, so the array consists of one element a1 and if we make a1=5 it will be divisible by k=5 and the minimum possible.\nIn the second test case, we can create array a=[1,2,1,2]. The sum is divisible by k=3 and the maximum is equal to 2.\nIn the third test case, we can create array a=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. The sum is divisible by k=8 and the maximum is equal to 1.",
