    "description": "You have an array of zeros a1,a2,…,an of length n.\nYou can perform two types of operations on it: \nWhat is the minimum number of operations of the first type needed to make all elements of the array equal to one?\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains one integer n (1≤n≤105) — the length of the array.\nNote that there is no limit on the sum of n over all test cases.\nFor each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of needed operations of first type.\nIn the first test case, you can perform an operation of the 1st type with i=1.\nIn the second test case, you can perform the following sequence of operations:\nIn the third test case, you can perform the following sequence of operations:",
