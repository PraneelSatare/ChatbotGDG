    "description": "Boboniu gives you\nHe allows you to do the following operation as many times as you want: \nYou should answer if it's possible to arrange all the balls into a palindrome after several (possibly zero) number of described operations. \nThe first line contains one integer T (1≤T≤100) denoting the number of test cases.\nFor each of the next T cases, the first line contains four integers r, g, b and w (0≤r,g,b,w≤109).\nFor each test case, print \"Yes\" if it's possible to arrange all the balls into a palindrome after doing several (possibly zero) number of described operations. Otherwise, print \"No\".\nIn the first test case, you're not able to do any operation and you can never arrange three balls of distinct colors into a palindrome.\nIn the second test case, after doing one operation, changing (8,1,9,3) to (7,0,8,6), one of those possible palindromes may be \"rrrwwwbbbbrbbbbwwwrrr\".\nA palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards. For example, \"rggbwbggr\", \"b\", \"gg\" are palindromes while \"rgbb\", \"gbbgr\" are not. Notice that an empty word, phrase, or sequence is palindrome.",
