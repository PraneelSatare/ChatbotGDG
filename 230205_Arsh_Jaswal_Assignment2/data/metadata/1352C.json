    "description": "You are given two positive integers n and k. Print the k-th positive integer that is not divisible by n.\nFor example, if n=3, and k=7, then all numbers that are not divisible by 3 are: 1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11,13…. The 7-th number among them is 10.\nThe first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases in the input. Next, t test cases are given, one per line.\nEach test case is two positive integers n (2≤n≤109) and k (1≤k≤109).\nFor each test case print the k-th positive integer that is not divisible by n.",
