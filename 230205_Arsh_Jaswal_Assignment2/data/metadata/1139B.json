    "description": "You went to the store, selling n types of chocolates. There are ai chocolates of type i in stock.\nYou have unlimited amount of cash (so you are not restricted by any prices) and want to buy as many chocolates as possible. However if you buy xi chocolates of type i (clearly, 0≤xi≤ai), then for all 1≤j<i at least one of the following must hold:\nFor example, the array x=[0,0,1,2,10] satisfies the requirement above (assuming that all ai≥xi), while arrays x=[0,1,0], x=[5,5] and x=[3,2] don't.\nCalculate the maximum number of chocolates you can buy.\nThe first line contains an integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105), denoting the number of types of chocolate.\nThe next line contains n integers ai (1≤ai≤109), denoting the number of chocolates of each type.\nPrint the maximum number of chocolates you can buy.\nIn the first example, it is optimal to buy: 0+0+1+3+6 chocolates.\nIn the second example, it is optimal to buy: 1+2+3+4+10 chocolates.\nIn the third example, it is optimal to buy: 0+0+0+1 chocolates.",
