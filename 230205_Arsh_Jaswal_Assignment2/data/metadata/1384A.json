    "description": "The length of the longest common prefix of two strings s=s1s2…sn and t=t1t2…tm is defined as the maximum integer k (0≤k≤min(n,m)) such that s1s2…sk equals t1t2…tk.\nKoa the Koala initially has n+1 strings s1,s2,…,sn+1.\nFor each i (1≤i≤n) she calculated ai — the length of the longest common prefix of si and si+1.\nSeveral days later Koa found these numbers, but she couldn't remember the strings.\nSo Koa would like to find some strings s1,s2,…,sn+1 which would have generated numbers a1,a2,…,an. Can you help her?\nIf there are many answers print any. We can show that answer always exists for the given constraints. \nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤100) — the number of elements in the list a.\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (0≤ai≤50) — the elements of a.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 100.\nFor each test case:\nOutput n+1 lines. In the i-th line print string si (1≤|si|≤200), consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Length of the longest common prefix of strings si and si+1 has to be equal to ai.\nIf there are many answers print any. We can show that answer always exists for the given constraints.\nIn the 1-st test case one of the possible answers is s=[aeren,ari,arousal,around,ari].\nLengths of longest common prefixes are:",
