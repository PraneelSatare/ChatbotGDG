    "description": "Monocarp is playing yet another computer game. And yet again, his character is killing some monsters. There are n monsters, numbered from 1 to n, and the i-th of them has ai health points initially.\nMonocarp's character has an ability that deals k damage to the monster with the highest current health. If there are several of them, the one with the smaller index is chosen. If a monster's health becomes less than or equal to 0 after Monocarp uses his ability, then it dies.\nMonocarp uses his ability until all monsters die. Your task is to determine the order in which monsters will die.\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1≤n≤3⋅105; 1≤k≤109) — the number of monsters and the damage which Monocarp's ability deals.\nThe second line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109) — the initial health points of monsters.\nThe sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3⋅105.\nFor each test case, print n integers — the indices of monsters in the order they die. \nIn the first example, the health points change as follows: [1,2,3_]→[1,2_,1]→[1_,0,1]→[−1,0,1_]→[−1,0,−1]. The monster that is going to take damage the next time Monocarp uses his ability is underlined.\nIn the second example, the health points change as follows: [1_,1]→[−2,1_]→[−2,−2].\nIn the third example, the health points change as follows: [2,8_,3,5]→[2,5_,3,5]→[2,2,3,5_]→[2,2,3_,2]→[2_,2,0,2]→[−1,2_,0,2]→[−1,−1,0,2_]→[−1,−1,0,−1].
