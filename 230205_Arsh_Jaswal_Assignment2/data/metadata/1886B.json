    "description": "Monocarp tries to get home from work. He is currently at the point O=(0,0) of a two-dimensional plane; his house is at the point P=(Px,Py).\nUnfortunately, it is late in the evening, so it is very dark. Monocarp is afraid of the darkness. He would like to go home along a path illuminated by something.\nThankfully, there are two lanterns, located in the points A=(Ax,Ay) and B=(Bx,By). You can choose any non-negative number w and set the power of both lanterns to w. If a lantern's power is set to w, it illuminates a circle of radius w centered at the lantern location (including the borders of the circle).\nYou have to choose the minimum non-negative value w for the power of the lanterns in such a way that there is a path from the point O to the point P which is completely illuminated. You may assume that the lanterns don't interfere with Monocarp's movement.\nThe first line of the input contains one integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of three lines:\nAdditional constraint on the input:\nFor each test case, print the answer on a separate line — one real number equal to the minimum value of w such that there is a completely illuminated path from the point O to the point P.\nYour answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10−6 — formally, if your answer is a, and the jury's answer is b, your answer will be accepted if |a−b|max(1,b)≤10−6.",
