    "description": "Tanya is learning how to add numbers, but so far she is not doing it correctly. She is adding two numbers a and b using the following algorithm:\nFor example, the numbers a=17236 and b=3465 Tanya adds up as follows:\n+17236034651106911\nAs a result, she gets 1106911.\nYou are given two positive integers a and s. Find the number b such that by adding a and b as described above, Tanya will get s. Or determine that no suitable b exists.\nThe first line of input data contains an integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of a single line containing two positive integers a and s (1≤a<s≤1018) separated by a space.\nFor each test case print the answer on a separate line.\nIf the solution exists, print a single positive integer b. The answer must be written without leading zeros. If multiple answers exist, print any of them.\nIf no suitable number b exists, output -1.\nThe first test case is explained in the main part of the statement.\nIn the third test case, we cannot choose b that satisfies the problem statement.",
