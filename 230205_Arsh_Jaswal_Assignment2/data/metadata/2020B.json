    "description": "Imagine you have n light bulbs numbered 1,2,…,n. Initially, all bulbs are on. To flip the state of a bulb means to turn it off if it used to be on, and to turn it on otherwise.\nNext, you do the following:\nAfter performing all operations, there will be several bulbs that are still on. Your goal is to make this number exactly k.\nFind the smallest suitable n such that after performing the operations there will be exactly k bulbs on. We can show that an answer always exists.\n† An integer x is divisible by y if there exists an integer z such that x=y⋅z.\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains a single integer k (1≤k≤1018).\nFor each test case, output n — the minimum number of bulbs.\nIn the first test case, the minimum number of bulbs is 2. Let's denote the state of all bulbs with an array, where 1 corresponds to a turned on bulb, and 0 corresponds to a turned off bulb. Initially, the array is [1,1].\nIn the end, there are k=1 bulbs on. We can also show that the answer cannot be less than 2.\nIn the second test case, the minimum number of bulbs is 5. Initially, the array is [1,1,1,1,1]. \nIn the end, there are k=3 bulbs on. We can also show that the answer cannot be smaller than 5.",
