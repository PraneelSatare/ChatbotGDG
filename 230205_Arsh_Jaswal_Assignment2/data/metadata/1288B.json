    "description": "You are given two integers A and B, calculate the number of pairs (a,b) such that 1≤a≤A, 1≤b≤B, and the equation a⋅b+a+b=conc(a,b) is true; conc(a,b) is the concatenation of a and b (for example, conc(12,23)=1223, conc(100,11)=10011). a and b should not contain leading zeroes.\nThe first line contains t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases.\nEach test case contains two integers A and B (1≤A,B≤109).\nPrint one integer — the number of pairs (a,b) such that 1≤a≤A, 1≤b≤B, and the equation a⋅b+a+b=conc(a,b) is true.\nThere is only one suitable pair in the first test case: a=1, b=9 (1+9+1⋅9=19).",
