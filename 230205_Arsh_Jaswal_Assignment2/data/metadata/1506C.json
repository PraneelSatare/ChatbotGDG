    "description": "You are given the strings a and b, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You can do any number of the following operations in any order: \nNote that after each of the operations, the string a or b may become empty.\nFor example, if a=\"hello\" and b=\"icpc\", then you can apply the following sequence of operations: \nFor the given strings a and b, find the minimum number of operations for which you can make the strings a and b equal. Note that empty strings are also equal.\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤100). Then t test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains the string a (1≤|a|≤20), consisting of lowercase Latin letters.\nThe second line of each test case contains the string b (1≤|b|≤20), consisting of lowercase Latin letters.\nFor each test case, output the minimum number of operations that can make the strings a and b equal.",
