    "description": "Monocarp had a sequence a consisting of n+m integers a1,a2,…,an+m. He painted the elements into two colors, red and blue; n elements were painted red, all other m elements were painted blue.\nAfter painting the elements, he has written two sequences r1,r2,…,rn and b1,b2,…,bm. The sequence r consisted of all red elements of a in the order they appeared in a; similarly, the sequence b consisted of all blue elements of a in the order they appeared in a as well.\nUnfortunately, the original sequence was lost, and Monocarp only has the sequences r and b. He wants to restore the original sequence. In case there are multiple ways to restore it, he wants to choose a way to restore that maximizes the value of \nf(a)=max(0,a1,(a1+a2),(a1+a2+a3),…,(a1+a2+a3+⋯+an+m))\nHelp Monocarp to calculate the maximum possible value of f(a).\nThe first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of four lines.\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer n (1≤n≤100).\nThe second line contains n integers r1,r2,…,rn (−100≤ri≤100).\nThe third line contains one integer m (1≤m≤100).\nThe fourth line contains m integers b1,b2,…,bm (−100≤bi≤100).\nFor each test case, print one integer — the maximum possible value of f(a).\nIn the explanations for the sample test cases, red elements are marked as bold.\nIn the first test case, one of the possible sequences a is [6,2,−5,3,7,−3,−4].\nIn the second test case, one of the possible sequences a is [10,1,−3,1,2,2].\nIn the third test case, one of the possible sequences a is [−1,−1,−2,−3,−2,−4,−5,−3,−4,−5].\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible sequences a is [0,0].",
