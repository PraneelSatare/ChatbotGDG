    "description": "We call a positive integer number fair if it is divisible by each of its nonzero digits. For example, 102 is fair (because it is divisible by 1 and 2), but 282 is not, because it isn't divisible by 8. Given a positive integer n. Find the minimum integer x, such that n≤x and x is fair.\nThe first line contains number of test cases t (1≤t≤103). Each of the next t lines contains an integer n (1≤n≤1018).\nFor each of t test cases print a single integer — the least fair number, which is not less than n.\nExplanations for some test cases: ",
