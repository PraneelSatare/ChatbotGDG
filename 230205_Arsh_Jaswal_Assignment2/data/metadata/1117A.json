Find the subsegment al,al+1,…,ar (1≤l≤r≤n) with maximum arithmetic mean 1r−l+1r∑i=lai (in floating-point numbers, i.e. without any rounding).\nIf there are many such subsegments find the longest one.\nThe first line contains single integer n (1≤n≤105) — length of the array a.\nThe second line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (0≤ai≤109) — the array a.\nPrint the single integer — the length of the longest subsegment with maximum possible arithmetic mean.\nThe subsegment [3,4] is the longest among all subsegments with maximum arithmetic mean.",
