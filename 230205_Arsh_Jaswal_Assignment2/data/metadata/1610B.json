    "description": "An array [b1,b2,…,bm] is a palindrome, if bi=bm+1−i for each i from 1 to m. Empty array is also a palindrome.\nAn array is called kalindrome, if the following condition holds:\nIt's possible to select some integer x and delete some of the elements of the array equal to x, so that the remaining array (after gluing together the remaining parts) is a palindrome. \nNote that you don't have to delete all elements equal to x, and you don't have to delete at least one element equal to x.\nFor example : \nYou are given an array [a1,a2,…,an]. Determine if a is kalindrome or not.\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of the array.\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤n) — elements of the array.\nIt's guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases won't exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each test case, print YES if a is kalindrome and NO otherwise. You can print each letter in any case.\nIn the first test case, array [1] is already a palindrome, so it's a kalindrome as well.\nIn the second test case, we can choose x=2, delete the second element, and obtain array [1], which is a palindrome.\nIn the third test case, it's impossible to obtain a palindrome.\nIn the fourth test case, you can choose x=4 and delete the fifth element, obtaining [1,4,4,1]. You also can choose x=1, delete the first and the fourth elements, and obtain [4,4,4].",
