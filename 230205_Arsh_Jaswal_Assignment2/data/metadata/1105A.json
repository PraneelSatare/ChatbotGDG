    "description": "Salem gave you n sticks with integer positive lengths a1,a2,…,an.\nFor every stick, you can change its length to any other positive integer length (that is, either shrink or stretch it). The cost of changing the stick's length from a to b is |a−b|, where |x| means the absolute value of x.\nA stick length ai is called almost good for some integer t if |ai−t|≤1.\nSalem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer t and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of t is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer. \nAs an answer, print the value of t and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for t, print any of them.\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1≤n≤1000) — the number of sticks.\nThe second line contains n integers ai (1≤ai≤100) — the lengths of the sticks.\nPrint the value of t and the minimum possible cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for t, print any of them.\nIn the first example, we can change 1 into 2 and 10 into 4 with cost |1−2|+|10−4|=1+6=7 and the resulting lengths [2,4,4] are almost good for t=3.\nIn the second example, the sticks lengths are already almost good for t=2, so we don't have to do anything.",
