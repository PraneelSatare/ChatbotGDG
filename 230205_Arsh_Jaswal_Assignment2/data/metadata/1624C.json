    "description": "You are given an array a consisting of n positive integers. You can perform operations on it.\nIn one operation you can replace any element of the array ai with ⌊ai2⌋, that is, by an integer part of dividing ai by 2 (rounding down).\nSee if you can apply the operation some number of times (possible 0) to make the array a become a permutation of numbers from 1 to n —that is, so that it contains all numbers from 1 to n, each exactly once.\nFor example, if a=[1,8,25,2], n=4, then the answer is yes. You could do the following:\nThe first line of input data contains an integer t (1≤t≤104) —the number of test cases.\nEach test case contains exactly two lines. The first one contains an integer n (1≤n≤50), the second one contains integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109).\nFor each test case, output on a separate line:\nYou can output YES and NO in any case (for example, strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as a positive response).\nThe first test case is explained in the text of the problem statement.\nIn the second test case, it is not possible to get a permutation.",
