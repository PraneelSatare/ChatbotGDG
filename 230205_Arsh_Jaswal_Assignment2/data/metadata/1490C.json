    "description": "You are given a positive integer x. Check whether the number x is representable as the sum of the cubes of two positive integers.\nFormally, you need to check if there are two integers a and b (1≤a,b) such that a3+b3=x.\nFor example, if x=35, then the numbers a=2 and b=3 are suitable (23+33=8+27=35). If x=4, then no pair of numbers a and b is suitable.\nThe first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.\nEach test case contains one integer x (1≤x≤1012).\nPlease note, that the input for some test cases won't fit into 32-bit integer type, so you should use at least 64-bit integer type in your programming language.\nFor each test case, output on a separate line: \nYou can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as positive).\nThe number 1 is not representable as the sum of two cubes.\nThe number 2 is represented as 13+13.\nThe number 4 is not representable as the sum of two cubes.\nThe number 34 is not representable as the sum of two cubes.\nThe number 35 is represented as 23+33.\nThe number 16 is represented as 23+23.\nThe number 703657519796 is represented as 57793+79933.",
