    "description": "You are given a sequence of integers of length n and integer number k. You should print any integer number x in the range of [1;109] (i.e. 1≤x≤109) such that exactly k elements of given sequence are less than or equal to x.\nNote that the sequence can contain equal elements.\nIf there is no such x, print \"-1\" (without quotes).\nThe first line of the input contains integer numbers n and k (1≤n≤2⋅105, 0≤k≤n). The second line of the input contains n integer numbers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109) — the sequence itself.\nPrint any integer number x from range [1;109] such that exactly k elements of given sequence is less or equal to x.\nIf there is no such x, print \"-1\" (without quotes).\nIn the first example 5 is also a valid answer because the elements with indices [1,3,4,6] is less than or equal to 5 and obviously less than or equal to 6.\nIn the second example you cannot choose any number that only 2 elements of the given sequence will be less than or equal to this number because 3 elements of the given sequence will be also less than or equal to this number.",
