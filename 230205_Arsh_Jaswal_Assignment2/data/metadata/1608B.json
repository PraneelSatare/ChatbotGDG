    "description": "You are given three integers n,a,b. Determine if there exists a permutation p1,p2,…,pn of integers from 1 to n, such that:\nThere are exactly a integers i with 2≤i≤n−1 such that pi−1<pi>pi+1 (in other words, there are exactly a local maximums).\nThere are exactly b integers i with 2≤i≤n−1 such that pi−1>pi<pi+1 (in other words, there are exactly b local minimums).\nIf such permutations exist, find any such permutation.\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains three integers n, a and b (2≤n≤105, 0≤a,b≤n).\nThe sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 105.\nFor each test case, if there is no permutation with the requested properties, output −1.\nOtherwise, print the permutation that you are found. If there are several such permutations, you may print any of them.\nIn the first test case, one example of such permutations is [1,3,2,4]. In it p1<p2>p3, and 2 is the only such index, and p2>p3<p4, and 3 the only such index.\nOne can show that there is no such permutation for the third test case.",
