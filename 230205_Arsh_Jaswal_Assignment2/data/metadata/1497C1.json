    "description": "It is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version k=3.\nYou are given a positive integer n. Find k positive integers a1,a2,…,ak, such that:\nHere LCM is the least common multiple of numbers a1,a2,…,ak.\nWe can show that for given constraints the answer always exists.\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104)  — the number of test cases.\nThe only line of each test case contains two integers n, k (3≤n≤109, k=3).\nFor each test case print k positive integers a1,a2,…,ak, for which all conditions are satisfied.",
