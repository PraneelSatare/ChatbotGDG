    "description": "You are given two positive integers n (1≤n≤109) and k (1≤k≤100). Represent the number n as the sum of k positive integers of the same parity (have the same remainder when divided by 2).\nIn other words, find a1,a2,…,ak such that all ai>0, n=a1+a2+…+ak and either all ai are even or all ai are odd at the same time.\nIf such a representation does not exist, then report it.\nThe first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases in the input. Next, t test cases are given, one per line.\nEach test case is two positive integers n (1≤n≤109) and k (1≤k≤100).\nFor each test case print:\nThe letters in the words YES and NO can be printed in any case.",
