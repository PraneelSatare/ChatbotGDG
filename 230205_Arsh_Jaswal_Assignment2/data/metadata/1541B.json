    "description": "You are given an array a1,a2,…,an consisting of n distinct integers. Count the number of pairs of indices (i,j) such that i<j and ai⋅aj=i+j.\nThe first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. Then t cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer n (2≤n≤105) — the length of array a.\nThe second line of each test case contains n space separated integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤2⋅n) — the array a. It is guaranteed that all elements are distinct.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each test case, output the number of pairs of indices (i,j) such that i<j and ai⋅aj=i+j.\nFor the first test case, the only pair that satisfies the constraints is (1,2), as a1⋅a2=1+2=3\nFor the second test case, the only pair that satisfies the constraints is (2,3).\nFor the third test case, the pairs that satisfy the constraints are (1,2), (1,5), and (2,3).",
