    "description": "Let's call a number a binary decimal if it is a positive integer and all digits in its decimal notation are either 0 or 1. For example, 1010111 is a binary decimal, while 10201 and 787788 are not.\nGiven a number n, you are asked whether or not it is possible to represent n as a product of some (not necessarily distinct) binary decimals.\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤5⋅104) — the number of test cases.\nThe only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤105).\nFor each test case, output \"YES\" (without quotes) if n can be represented as a product of binary decimals, and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.\nYou can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, strings \"yES\", \"yes\", and \"Yes\" will be recognized as a positive response).\nThe first five test cases can be represented as a product of binary decimals as follows: ",
