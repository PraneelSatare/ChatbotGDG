    "description": "There is a graph of n rows and 106+2 columns, where rows are numbered from 1 to n and columns from 0 to 106+1:\nLet's denote the node in the row i and column j by (i,j).\nInitially for each i the i-th row has exactly one obstacle — at node (i,ai). You want to move some obstacles so that you can reach node (n,106+1) from node (1,0) by moving through edges of this graph (you can't pass through obstacles). Moving one obstacle to an adjacent by edge free node costs u or v coins, as below:\nRefer to the picture above for a better understanding. \nNow you need to calculate the minimal number of coins you need to spend to be able to reach node (n,106+1) from node (1,0) by moving through edges of this graph without passing through obstacles.\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n, u and v (2≤n≤100, 1≤u,v≤109) — the number of rows in the graph and the numbers of coins needed to move vertically and horizontally respectively.\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤106) — where ai represents that the obstacle in the i-th row is in node (i,ai).\nIt's guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅104.\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the minimal number of coins you need to spend to be able to reach node (n,106+1) from node (1,0) by moving through edges of this graph without passing through obstacles.\nIt can be shown that under the constraints of the problem there is always a way to make such a trip possible.\nIn the first sample, two obstacles are at (1,2) and (2,2). You can move the obstacle on (2,2) to (2,3), then to (1,3). The total cost is u+v=7 coins.\nIn the second sample, two obstacles are at (1,3) and (2,2). You can move the obstacle on (1,3) to (2,3). The cost is u=3 coins.",
