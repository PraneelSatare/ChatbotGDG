    "description": "You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9.\nYou can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): swap the i-th digit in x and the i-th digit in y.\nFor example, if x=73 and y=31, you can swap the 2-nd digits and get x=71 and y=33.\nYour task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1≤x<10100).\nThe second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1≤y<10100).\nAdditional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9.\nFor each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.",
