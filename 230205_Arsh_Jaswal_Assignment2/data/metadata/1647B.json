    "description": "Madoka's father just reached 1 million subscribers on Mathub! So the website decided to send him a personalized award — The Mathhub's Bit Button! \nThe Bit Button is a rectangular table with n rows and m columns with 0 or 1 in each cell. After exploring the table Madoka found out that:\nFor example, in the first illustration the red subrectangle is nice, but in the second one it's not, because it's contained in the purple subrectangle.\nHelp Madoka to determine whether the table is elegant.\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤200) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two positive integers n,m (1≤n,m≤100).\nThe next n lines contain strings of length m consisting of zeros and ones — the description of the table.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and the sum of the values of m for all test cases do not exceed 777.\nFor each test case print \"YES\" if its table is elegant or print \"NO\" otherwise.\nYou may print each letter in any case (for example, \"YES\", \"Yes\", \"yes\", \"yEs\" will all be recognized as positive answer).\nIn the second test case the table is not elegant, because the red and the purple subrectangles are nice and intersect. \nIn the fourth test case the table is not elegant, because the red and the purple subrectangles are nice and intersect.
