    "description": "You are given a integer n (n>0). Find any integer s which satisfies these conditions, or report that there are no such numbers:\nIn the decimal representation of s: \nThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤400), the number of test cases. The next t lines each describe a test case.\nEach test case contains one positive integer n (1≤n≤105).\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 105.\nFor each test case, print an integer s which satisfies the conditions described above, or \"-1\" (without quotes), if no such number exists. If there are multiple possible solutions for s, print any solution.\nIn the first test case, there are no possible solutions for s consisting of one digit, because any such solution is divisible by itself.\nFor the second test case, the possible solutions are: 23, 27, 29, 34, 37, 38, 43, 46, 47, 49, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58, 59, 67, 68, 69, 73, 74, 76, 78, 79, 83, 86, 87, 89, 94, 97, and 98.\nFor the third test case, one possible solution is 239 because 239 is not divisible by 2, 3 or 9 and has three digits (none of which equals zero).",
