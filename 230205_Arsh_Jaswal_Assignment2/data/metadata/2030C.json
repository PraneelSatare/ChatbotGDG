    "description": "Alice and Bob are playing a game. There is a list of n booleans, each of which is either true or false, given as a binary string ∗ of length n (where 1 represents true, and 0 represents false). Initially, there are no operators between the booleans.\nAlice and Bob will take alternate turns placing and or or between the booleans, with Alice going first. Thus, the game will consist of n−1 turns since there are n booleans. Alice aims for the final statement to evaluate to true, while Bob aims for it to evaluate to false. Given the list of boolean values, determine whether Alice will win if both players play optimally.\nTo evaluate the final expression, repeatedly perform the following steps until the statement consists of a single true or false: \n∗A binary string is a string that only consists of characters 0 and 1\nThe first line contains t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer n (2≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of the string.\nThe second line contains a binary string of length n, consisting of characters 0 and 1 — the list of boolean values.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each testcase, output \"YES\" (without quotes) if Alice wins, and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.\nYou can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, strings \"yES\", \"yes\" and \"Yes\" will be recognized as a positive response).\nIn the first testcase, Alice can place and between the two booleans. The game ends as there are no other places to place operators, and Alice wins because true and true is true.\nIn the second testcase, Alice can place or between the middle true and the left false. Bob can place and between the middle true and the right false. The statement false or true and false is false.\nNote that these examples may not be the best strategies for either Alice or Bob.",
