    "description": "Andrey is just starting to come up with problems, and it's difficult for him. That's why he came up with a strange problem about permutations† and asks you to solve it. Can you do it?\nLet's call the cost of a permutation p of length n the value of the expression:\nFind the maximum cost among all permutations of length n.\n†A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤30) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains a single integer n (2≤n≤250) — the length of the permutation.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 500.\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum cost among all permutations of length n.\nIn the first test case, the permutation with the maximum cost is [2,1]. The cost is equal to 2⋅1+1⋅2−max(2⋅1,1⋅2)=2+2−2=2.\nIn the second test case, the permutation with the maximum cost is [1,2,4,3]. The cost is equal to 1⋅1+2⋅2+4⋅3+3⋅4−4⋅3=17.",
