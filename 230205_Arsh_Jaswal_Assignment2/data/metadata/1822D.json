    "description": "A permutation is a sequence n integers, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once. For example, [1], [3,5,2,1,4], [1,3,2] are permutations, while [2,3,2], [4,3,1], [0] are not.\nGiven a permutation a, we construct an array b, where bi=(a1+a2+ … +ai)modn.\nA permutation of numbers [a1,a2,…,an] is called a super-permutation if [b1+1,b2+1,…,bn+1] is also a permutation of length n.\nGrisha became interested whether a super-permutation of length n exists. Help him solve this non-trivial problem. Output any super-permutation of length n, if it exists. Otherwise, output −1.\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\nEach test case consists of a single line containing one integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of the desired permutation.\nThe sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each test case, output in a separate line:\nIf there are several suitable permutations, output any of them.",
