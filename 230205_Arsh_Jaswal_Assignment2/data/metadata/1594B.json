    "description": "Theofanis really likes sequences of positive integers, thus his teacher (Yeltsa Kcir) gave him a problem about a sequence that consists of only special numbers.\nLet's call a positive number special if it can be written as a sum of different non-negative powers of n. For example, for n=4 number 17 is special, because it can be written as 40+42=1+16=17, but 9 is not.\nTheofanis asks you to help him find the k-th special number if they are sorted in increasing order. Since this number may be too large, output it modulo 109+7.\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2≤n≤109; 1≤k≤109).\nFor each test case, print one integer — the k-th special number in increasing order modulo 109+7.\nFor n=3 the sequence is [1,3,4,9...]",
