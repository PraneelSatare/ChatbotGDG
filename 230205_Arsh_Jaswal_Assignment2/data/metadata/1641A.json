    "description": "A sequence of positive integers is called great for a positive integer x, if we can split it into pairs in such a way that in each pair the first number multiplied by x is equal to the second number. More formally, a sequence a of size n is great for a positive integer x, if n is even and there exists a permutation p of size n, such that for each i (1≤i≤n2) ap2i−1⋅x=ap2i. \nSam has a sequence a and a positive integer x. Help him to make the sequence great: find the minimum possible number of positive integers that should be added to the sequence a to make it great for the number x.\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤20000) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n, x (1≤n≤2⋅105, 2≤x≤106).\nThe next line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109).\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each test case print a single integer — the minimum number of integers that can be added to the end of a to make it a great sequence for the number x.\nIn the first test case, Sam got lucky and the sequence is already great for the number 4 because you can divide it into such pairs: (1,4), (4,16). Thus we can add 0 numbers.\nIn the second test case, you can add numbers 1 and 14 to the sequence, then you can divide all 8 integers into such pairs: (1,2), (1,2), (2,4), (7,14). It is impossible to add less than 2 integers to fix the sequence.",
