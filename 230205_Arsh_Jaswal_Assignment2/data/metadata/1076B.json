    "description": "You are given an integer number n. The following algorithm is applied to it:\nDetermine the number of subtrations the algorithm will make.\nThe only line contains a single integer n (2≤n≤1010).\nPrint a single integer — the number of subtractions the algorithm will make.\nIn the first example 5 is the smallest prime divisor, thus it gets subtracted right away to make a 0.\nIn the second example 2 is the smallest prime divisor at both steps.",
