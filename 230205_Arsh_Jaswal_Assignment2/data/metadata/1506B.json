    "description": "You are given a number k and a string s of length n, consisting of the characters '.' and '*'. You want to replace some of the '*' characters with 'x' characters so that the following conditions are met: \nFor example, if n=7, s=.**.*** and k=3, then the following strings will satisfy the conditions above: \nGiven n, k, and s, find the minimum number of '*' characters that must be replaced with 'x' in order to meet the above conditions.\nThe first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤500). Then t test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1≤k≤n≤50).\nThe second line of each test case contains a string s of length n, consisting of the characters '.' and '*'.\nIt is guaranteed that there is at least one '*' in the string s.\nIt is guaranteed that the distance between any two neighboring '*' characters does not exceed k.\nFor each test case output the minimum number of '*' characters that must be replaced with 'x' characters in order to satisfy the conditions above.",
