    "description": "Vlad found a strip of n cells, numbered from left to right from 1 to n. In the i-th cell, there is a positive integer ai and a letter si, where all si are either 'L' or 'R'.\nVlad invites you to try to score the maximum possible points by performing any (possibly zero) number of operations.\nIn one operation, you can choose two indices l and r (1≤l<r≤n) such that sl = 'L' and sr = 'R' and do the following:\nFor example, consider the following strip:\nYou can first choose l=1, r=2 and add 3+5=8 to your score.\nThen choose l=3, r=6 and add 1+4+3+2=10 to your score.\nAs a result, it is impossible to perform another operation, and the final score is 18.\nWhat is the maximum score that can be achieved?\nThe first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer n (2≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of the strip.\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤105) — the numbers written on the strip.\nThe third line of each test case contains a string s of n characters 'L' and 'R'.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each test case, output one integer — the maximum possible number of points that can be scored.",
