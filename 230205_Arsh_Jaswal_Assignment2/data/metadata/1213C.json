    "description": "Polycarp is reading a book consisting of n pages numbered from 1 to n. Every time he finishes the page with the number divisible by m, he writes down the last digit of this page number. For example, if n=15 and m=5, pages divisible by m are 5,10,15. Their last digits are 5,0,5 correspondingly, their sum is 10.\nYour task is to calculate the sum of all digits Polycarp has written down.\nYou have to answer q independent queries.\nThe first line of the input contains one integer q (1≤q≤1000) — the number of queries.\nThe following q lines contain queries, one per line. Each query is given as two integers n and m (1≤n,m≤1016) — the number of pages in the book and required divisor, respectively.\nFor each query print the answer for it — the sum of digits written down by Polycarp.",
