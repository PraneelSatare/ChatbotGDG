The height of the tree i is hi. Liss wants to eat all nuts.\nNow Liss is on the root of the tree with the number 1. In one second Liss can perform one of the following actions:\nCompute the minimal time (in seconds) required to eat all nuts.\nThe first line contains an integer n (1  ≤  n ≤ 105) — the number of trees.\nNext n lines contains the height of trees: i-th line contains an integer hi (1 ≤ hi ≤ 104) — the height of the tree with the number i.\nPrint a single integer — the minimal time required to eat all nuts in seconds.",
