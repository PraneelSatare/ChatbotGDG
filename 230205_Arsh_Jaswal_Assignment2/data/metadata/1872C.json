    "description": "You are given two integers l≤r. You need to find positive integers a and b such that the following conditions are simultaneously satisfied:\nor report that they do not exist.\ngcd(a,b) denotes the greatest common divisor of numbers a and b. For example, gcd(6,9)=3, gcd(8,9)=1, gcd(4,2)=2.\nThe first line of the input contains an integer t (1≤t≤500) — the number of test cases.\nThen the descriptions of the test cases follow.\nThe only line of the description of each test case contains 2 integers l,r (1≤l≤r≤107).\nFor each test case, output the integers a,b that satisfy all the conditions on a separate line. If there is no answer, instead output a single number −1.\nIf there are multiple answers, you can output any of them.\nIn the first test case, 11≤6+9≤15, gcd(6,9)=3, and all conditions are satisfied. Note that this is not the only possible answer, for example, {4,10},{5,10},{6,6} are also valid answers for this test case.\nIn the second test case, the only pairs {a,b} that satisfy the condition 1≤a+b≤3 are {1,1},{1,2},{2,1}, but in each of these pairs gcd(a,b) equals 1, so there is no answer.\nIn the third sample test, gcd(14,4)=2.",
