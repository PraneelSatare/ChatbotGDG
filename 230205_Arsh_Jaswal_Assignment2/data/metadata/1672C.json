    "description": "You are given an array a of length n. We define the equality of the array as the number of indices 1≤i≤n−1 such that ai=ai+1. We are allowed to do the following operation:\nFind the minimum number of operations needed such that the equality of the array is less than or equal to 1.\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer n (2≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of array a.\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109) — elements of the array.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105\nFor each test case, print the minimum number of operations needed.\nIn the first test case, we can select i=2 and x=2 to form [1,2,2,1,1]. Then, we can select i=3 and x=3 to form [1,2,3,3,1].\nIn the second test case, we can select i=3 and x=100 to form [2,1,100,100,2].",
