    "description": "Adilbek was assigned to a special project. For Adilbek it means that he has n days to run a special program and provide its results. But there is a problem: the program needs to run for d days to calculate the results.\nFortunately, Adilbek can optimize the program. If he spends x (x is a non-negative integer) days optimizing the program, he will make the program run in ⌈dx+1⌉ days (⌈a⌉ is the ceiling function: ⌈2.4⌉=3, ⌈2⌉=2). The program cannot be run and optimized simultaneously, so the total number of days he will spend is equal to x+⌈dx+1⌉.\nWill Adilbek be able to provide the generated results in no more than n days?\nThe first line contains a single integer T (1≤T≤50) — the number of test cases.\nThe next T lines contain test cases – one per line. Each line contains two integers n and d (1≤n≤109, 1≤d≤109) — the number of days before the deadline and the number of days the program runs.\nPrint T answers — one per test case. For each test case print YES (case insensitive) if Adilbek can fit in n days or NO (case insensitive) otherwise.\nIn the first test case, Adilbek decides not to optimize the program at all, since d≤n.\nIn the second test case, Adilbek can spend 1 day optimizing the program and it will run ⌈52⌉=3 days. In total, he will spend 4 days and will fit in the limit.\nIn the third test case, it's impossible to fit in the limit. For example, if Adilbek will optimize the program 2 days, it'll still work ⌈112+1⌉=4 days.",
