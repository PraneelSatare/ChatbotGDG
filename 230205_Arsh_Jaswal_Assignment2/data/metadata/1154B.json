    "description": "You are given a sequence a1,a2,…,an consisting of n integers.\nYou can choose any non-negative integer D (i.e. D≥0), and for each ai you can:\nIt is possible that after an operation the value ai becomes negative.\nYour goal is to choose such minimum non-negative integer D and perform changes in such a way, that all ai are equal (i.e. a1=a2=⋯=an).\nPrint the required D or, if it is impossible to choose such value D, print -1.\nFor example, for array [2,8] the value D=3 is minimum possible because you can obtain the array [5,5] if you will add D to 2 and subtract D from 8. And for array [1,4,7,7] the value D=3 is also minimum possible. You can add it to 1 and subtract it from 7 and obtain the array [4,4,4,4].\nThe first line of the input contains one integer n (1≤n≤100) — the number of elements in a.\nThe second line of the input contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤100) — the sequence a.\nPrint one integer — the minimum non-negative integer value D such that if you add this value to some ai, subtract this value from some ai and leave some ai without changes, all obtained values become equal.\nIf it is impossible to choose such value D, print -1.",
