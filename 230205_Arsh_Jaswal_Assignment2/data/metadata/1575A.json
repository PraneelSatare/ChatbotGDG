    "description": "Andi and Budi were given an assignment to tidy up their bookshelf of n books. Each book is represented by the book title — a string si numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.\nSettling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.\nA string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1≤n⋅m≤106).\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains a string si consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.\nOutput n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.\nThe following illustrates the first example.",
