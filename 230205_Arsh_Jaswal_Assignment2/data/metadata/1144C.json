    "title": "C. Two Shuffled Sequences",
    "description": "Two integer sequences existed initially — one of them was strictly increasing, and the other one — strictly decreasing.\nStrictly increasing sequence is a sequence of integers [x1<x2<⋯<xk]. And strictly decreasing sequence is a sequence of integers [y1>y2>⋯>yl]. Note that the empty sequence and the sequence consisting of one element can be considered as increasing or decreasing.\nThey were merged into one sequence a. After that sequence a got shuffled. For example, some of the possible resulting sequences a for an increasing sequence [1,3,4] and a decreasing sequence [10,4,2] are sequences [1,2,3,4,4,10] or [4,2,1,10,4,3].\nThis shuffled sequence a is given in the input.\nYour task is to find any two suitable initial sequences. One of them should be strictly increasing and the other one — strictly decreasing. Note that the empty sequence and the sequence consisting of one element can be considered as increasing or decreasing.\nIf there is a contradiction in the input and it is impossible to split the given sequence a to increasing and decreasing sequences, print \"NO\".\nThe first line of the input contains one integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of elements in a.\nThe second line of the input contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (0≤ai≤2⋅105), where ai is the i-th element of a.\nIf there is a contradiction in the input and it is impossible to split the given sequence a to increasing and decreasing sequences, print \"NO\" in the first line.\nOtherwise print \"YES\" in the first line and any two suitable sequences. Note that the empty sequence and the sequence consisting of one element can be considered as increasing or decreasing.\nIn the second line print ni — the number of elements in the strictly increasing sequence. ni can be zero, in this case the increasing sequence is empty.\nIn the third line print ni integers inc1,inc2,…,incni in the increasing order of its values (inc1<inc2<⋯<incni) — the strictly increasing sequence itself. You can keep this line empty if ni=0 (or just print the empty line).\nIn the fourth line print nd — the number of elements in the strictly decreasing sequence. nd can be zero, in this case the decreasing sequence is empty.\nIn the fifth line print nd integers dec1,dec2,…,decnd in the decreasing order of its values (dec1>dec2>⋯>decnd) — the strictly decreasing sequence itself. You can keep this line empty if nd=0 (or just print the empty line).\nni+nd should be equal to n and the union of printed sequences should be a permutation of the given sequence (in case of \"YES\" answer).",
