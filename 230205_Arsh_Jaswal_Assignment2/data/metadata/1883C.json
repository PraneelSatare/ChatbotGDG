    "description": "You are given an array of integers a1,a2,…,an and a number k (2≤k≤5). In one operation, you can do the following:\nFind the minimum number of operations needed to make the product of all the numbers in the array a1⋅a2⋅…⋅an divisible by k.\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2≤n≤105, 2≤k≤5) — the size of the array a and the number k.\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤10).\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each test case, output the minimum number of operations needed to make the product of all the numbers in the array divisible by k.\nIn the first test case, we need to choose the index i=2 twice. After that, the array will be a=[7,5]. The product of all the numbers in the array is 35.\nIn the fourth test case, the product of the numbers in the array is 120, which is already divisible by 5, so no operations are needed.\nIn the eighth test case, we can perform two operations by choosing i=2 and i=3 in any order. After that, the array will be a=[1,6,10]. The product of the numbers in the array is 60.",
