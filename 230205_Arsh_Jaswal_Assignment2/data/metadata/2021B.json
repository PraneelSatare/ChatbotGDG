    "description": "You are given an array a of n positive integers and an integer x. You can do the following two-step operation any (possibly zero) number of times: \nFind the maximum value of the MEX of a if you perform the operations optimally.\nThe MEX (minimum excluded value) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array. For example: \nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤5000). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1≤n≤2⋅105; 1≤x≤109) — the length of the array and the integer to be used in the operation.\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (0≤ai≤109) — the given array.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each test case, output a single integer: the maximum MEX of a if you perform the operations optimally.\nIn the first test case, the MEX of a is 4 without performing any operations, which is the maximum.\nIn the second test case, the MEX of a is 5 without performing any operations. If we perform two operations both with i=1, we will have the array a=[5,3,4,1,0,2]. Then, the MEX of a will become 6, which is the maximum.\nIn the third test case, the MEX of a is 0 without performing any operations, which is the maximum.",
