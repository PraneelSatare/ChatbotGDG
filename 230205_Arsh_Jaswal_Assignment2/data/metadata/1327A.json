    "description": "You are given two integers n and k. Your task is to find if n can be represented as a sum of k distinct positive odd (not divisible by 2) integers or not.\nYou have to answer t independent test cases.\nThe first line of the input contains one integer t (1≤t≤105) — the number of test cases.\nThe next t lines describe test cases. The only line of the test case contains two integers n and k (1≤n,k≤107).\nFor each test case, print the answer — \"YES\" (without quotes) if n can be represented as a sum of k distinct positive odd (not divisible by 2) integers and \"NO\" otherwise.\nIn the first test case, you can represent 3 as 3.\nIn the second test case, the only way to represent 4 is 1+3.\nIn the third test case, you cannot represent 10 as the sum of three distinct positive odd integers.\nIn the fourth test case, you can represent 10 as 3+7, for example.\nIn the fifth test case, you can represent 16 as 1+3+5+7.\nIn the sixth test case, you cannot represent 16 as the sum of five distinct positive odd integers.",
