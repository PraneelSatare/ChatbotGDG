    "description": "Let's write all the positive integer numbers one after another from 1 without any delimiters (i.e. as a single string). It will be the infinite sequence starting with 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536...\nYour task is to print the k-th digit of this sequence.\nThe first and only line contains integer k (1≤k≤10000) — the position to process (1-based index).\nPrint the k-th digit of the resulting infinite sequence.",
