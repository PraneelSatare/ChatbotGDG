    "description": "You may have already known that a standard ICPC team consists of exactly three members. The perfect team however has more restrictions. A student can have some specialization: coder or mathematician. She/he can have no specialization, but can't have both at the same time.\nSo the team is considered perfect if it includes at least one coder, at least one mathematician and it consists of exactly three members.\nYou are a coach at a very large university and you know that c of your students are coders, m are mathematicians and x have no specialization.\nWhat is the maximum number of full perfect teams you can distribute them into? \nNote that some students can be left without a team and each student can be a part of no more than one team.\nYou are also asked to answer q independent queries.\nThe first line contains a single integer q (1≤q≤104) — the number of queries. \nEach of the next q lines contains three integers c, m and x (0≤c,m,x≤108) — the number of coders, mathematicians and students without any specialization in the university, respectively.\nNote that the no student is both coder and mathematician at the same time. \nPrint q integers — the i-th of them should be the answer to the i query in the order they are given in the input. The answer is the maximum number of full perfect teams you can distribute your students into. \nIn the first example here are how teams are formed:",
