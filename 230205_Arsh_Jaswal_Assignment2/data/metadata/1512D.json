    "description": "You are given a number n and an array b1,b2,…,bn+2, obtained according to the following algorithm: \nFor example, the array b=[2,3,7,12,2] it could be obtained in the following ways: \nFor the given array b, find any array a that could have been guessed initially.\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104). Then t test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105).\nThe second row of each test case contains n+2 integers b1,b2,…,bn+2 (1≤bi≤109).\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each test case, output: \nIf there are several arrays of a, you can output any.",
