    "description": "You are given n strings s1,s2,…,sn of length at most 8. \nFor each string si, determine if there exist two strings sj and sk such that si=sj+sk. That is, si is the concatenation of sj and sk. Note that j can be equal to k.\nRecall that the concatenation of strings s and t is s+t=s1s2…spt1t2…tq, where p and q are the lengths of strings s and t respectively. For example, concatenation of \"code\" and \"forces\" is \"codeforces\".\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤105) — the number of strings.\nThen n lines follow, the i-th of which contains non-empty string si of length at most 8, consisting of lowercase English letters. Among the given n strings, there may be equal (duplicates).\nThe sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 105.\nFor each test case, output a binary string of length n. The i-th bit should be 1 if there exist two strings sj and sk where si=sj+sk, and 0 otherwise. Note that j can be equal to k.\nIn the first test case, we have the following: ",
