    "description": "Black is gifted with a Divine array a consisting of n (1≤n≤2000) integers. Each position in a has an initial value. After shouting a curse over the array, it becomes angry and starts an unstoppable transformation.\nThe transformation consists of infinite steps. Array a changes at the i-th step in the following way: for every position j, aj becomes equal to the number of occurrences of aj in a before starting this step.\nHere is an example to help you understand the process better: \nIn the initial array, we had two 2-s, three 1-s, only one 4 and only one 3, so after the first step, each element became equal to the number of its occurrences in the initial array: all twos changed to 2, all ones changed to 3, four changed to 1 and three changed to 1.\nThe transformation steps continue forever.\nYou have to process q queries: in each query, Black is curious to know the value of ax after the k-th step of transformation.\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤1000). Description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer n (1≤n≤2000) — the size of the array a.\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤n) — the initial values of array a.\nThe third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1≤q≤100000) — the number of queries.\nNext q lines contain the information about queries — one query per line. The i-th line contains two integers xi and ki (1≤xi≤n; 0≤ki≤109), meaning that Black is asking for the value of axi after the ki-th step of transformation. ki=0 means that Black is interested in values of the initial array.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2000 and the sum of q over all test cases doesn't exceed 100000.\nFor each test case, print q answers. The i-th of them should be the value of axi after the ki-th step of transformation. It can be shown that the answer to each query is unique.\nThe first test case was described ih the statement. It can be seen that: \nFor the second test case, \n\nIt can be seen that: ",
