    "description": "You are given an array a of n elements. You can apply the following operation to it any number of times:\nFor example, if a=[2,1,3,4,5,3], then choose l=1 and k=2, applying this operation the array will become a=[3,4,3,4,5,3].\nFind the minimum number of operations (possibly zero) needed to make all the elements of the array equal.\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤2⋅104) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of the array.\nThe second line of each test case consists of n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤n) — the elements of the array a.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.\nPrint t lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case — the minimum number of operations needed to make equal all the elements of the array with the given operation.\nIn the first test, all elements are equal, therefore no operations are needed.\nIn the second test, you can apply one operation with k=1 and l=1, set a1:=a2, and the array becomes [1,1] with 1 operation.\nIn the third test, you can apply one operation with k=1 and l=4, set a4:=a5, and the array becomes [4,4,4,4,4].\nIn the fourth test, you can apply one operation with k=1 and l=3, set a3:=a4, and the array becomes [4,2,3,3], then you can apply another operation with k=2 and l=1, set a1:=a3, a2:=a4, and the array becomes [3,3,3,3].\nIn the fifth test, there is only one element, therefore no operations are needed.",
