    "description": "A string is called beautiful if no two consecutive characters are equal. For example, \"ababcb\", \"a\" and \"abab\" are beautiful strings, while \"aaaaaa\", \"abaa\" and \"bb\" are not.\nAhcl wants to construct a beautiful string. He has a string s, consisting of only characters 'a', 'b', 'c' and '?'. Ahcl needs to replace each character '?' with one of the three characters 'a', 'b' or 'c', such that the resulting string is beautiful. Please help him!\nMore formally, after replacing all characters '?', the condition si≠si+1 should be satisfied for all 1≤i≤|s|−1, where |s| is the length of the string s.\nThe first line contains positive integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases. Next t lines contain the descriptions of test cases.\nEach line contains a non-empty string s consisting of only characters 'a', 'b', 'c' and '?'. \nIt is guaranteed that in each test case a string s has at least one character '?'. The sum of lengths of strings s in all test cases does not exceed 105.\nFor each test case given in the input print the answer in the following format:\nIn the first test case, all possible correct answers are \"ababcb\", \"abcacb\", \"abcbcb\", \"acabcb\" and \"acbacb\". The two answers \"abcbab\" and \"abaabc\" are incorrect, because you can replace only '?' characters and the resulting string must be beautiful.\nIn the second test case, it is impossible to create a beautiful string, because the 4-th and 5-th characters will be always equal.\nIn the third test case, the only answer is \"acbac\".",
