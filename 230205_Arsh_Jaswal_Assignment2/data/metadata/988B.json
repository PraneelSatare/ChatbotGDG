    "description": "You are given n strings. Each string consists of lowercase English letters. Rearrange (reorder) the given strings in such a way that for every string, all strings that are placed before it are its substrings.\nString a is a substring of string b if it is possible to choose several consecutive letters in b in such a way that they form a. For example, string \"for\" is contained as a substring in strings \"codeforces\", \"for\" and \"therefore\", but is not contained as a substring in strings \"four\", \"fofo\" and \"rof\".\nThe first line contains an integer n (1≤n≤100) — the number of strings.\nThe next n lines contain the given strings. The number of letters in each string is from 1 to 100, inclusive. Each string consists of lowercase English letters.\nSome strings might be equal.\nIf it is impossible to reorder n given strings in required order, print \"NO\" (without quotes).\nOtherwise print \"YES\" (without quotes) and n given strings in required order.\nIn the second example you cannot reorder the strings because the string \"abab\" is not a substring of the string \"abacaba\".",
