    "title": "B. Numbers on the Chessboard",
    "description": "You are given a chessboard of size n×n. It is filled with numbers from 1 to n2 in the following way: the first ⌈n22⌉ numbers from 1 to ⌈n22⌉ are written in the cells with even sum of coordinates from left to right from top to bottom. The rest n2−⌈n22⌉ numbers from ⌈n22⌉+1 to n2 are written in the cells with odd sum of coordinates from left to right from top to bottom. The operation ⌈xy⌉ means division x by y rounded up.\nFor example, the left board on the following picture is the chessboard which is given for n=4 and the right board is the chessboard which is given for n=5.\nYou are given q queries. The i-th query is described as a pair xi,yi. The answer to the i-th query is the number written in the cell xi,yi (xi is the row, yi is the column). Rows and columns are numbered from 1 to n.\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (1≤n≤109, 1≤q≤105) — the size of the board and the number of queries.\nThe next q lines contain two integers each. The i-th line contains two integers xi,yi (1≤xi,yi≤n) — description of the i-th query.\nFor each query from 1 to q print the answer to this query. The answer to the i-th query is the number written in the cell xi,yi (xi is the row, yi is the column). Rows and columns are numbered from 1 to n. Queries are numbered from 1 to q in order of the input.\nAnswers to the queries from examples are on the board in the picture from the problem statement.",
