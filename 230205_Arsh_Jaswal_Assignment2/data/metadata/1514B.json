    "description": "Baby Badawy's first words were \"AND 0 SUM BIG\", so he decided to solve the following problem. Given two integers n and k, count the number of arrays of length n such that:\nSince the answer can be very large, print its remainder when divided by 109+7.\nThe first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤10) — the number of test cases you need to solve.\nEach test case consists of a line containing two integers n and k (1≤n≤105, 1≤k≤20).\nFor each test case, print the number of arrays satisfying the conditions. Since the answer can be very large, print its remainder when divided by 109+7.\nIn the first example, the 4 arrays are:",
