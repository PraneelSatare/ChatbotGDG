    "description": "Berland shop sells n kinds of juices. Each juice has its price ci. Each juice includes some set of vitamins in it. There are three types of vitamins: vitamin \"A\", vitamin \"B\" and vitamin \"C\". Each juice can contain one, two or all three types of vitamins in it.\nPetya knows that he needs all three types of vitamins to stay healthy. What is the minimum total price of juices that Petya has to buy to obtain all three vitamins? Petya obtains some vitamin if he buys at least one juice containing it and drinks it.\nThe first line contains a single integer n (1≤n≤1000) — the number of juices.\nEach of the next n lines contains an integer ci (1≤ci≤100000) and a string si — the price of the i-th juice and the vitamins it contains. String si contains from 1 to 3 characters, and the only possible characters are \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\". It is guaranteed that each letter appears no more than once in each string si. The order of letters in strings si is arbitrary.\nPrint -1 if there is no way to obtain all three vitamins. Otherwise print the minimum total price of juices that Petya has to buy to obtain all three vitamins.\nIn the first example Petya buys the first, the second and the fourth juice. He spends 5+6+4=15 and obtains all three vitamins. He can also buy just the third juice and obtain three vitamins, but its cost is 16, which isn't optimal.\nIn the second example Petya can't obtain all three vitamins, as no juice contains vitamin \"C\".",
