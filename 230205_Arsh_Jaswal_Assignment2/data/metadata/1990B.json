Construct an array a of size n satisfying:\nIf there are multiple arrays that meet the conditions, print any. It can be proven that such an array always exists under the given conditions.\nThe first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.\nFor each test case: \nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases will not exceed 105.\nFor each test case, output n space-separated integers a1,a2,…,an in a new line.\nIn the second test case, \nThus, the array a=[1,−1,1,1] is considered correct.",
