    "description": "You are given two arrays of integers — a1,…,an of length n, and b1,…,bm of length m. You can choose any element bj from array b (1≤j≤m), and for all 1≤i≤n perform ai=ai|bj. You can perform any number of such operations.\nAfter all the operations, the value of x=a1⊕a2⊕…⊕an will be calculated. Find the minimum and maximum values of x that could be obtained after performing any set of operations.\nAbove, | is the bitwise OR operation, and ⊕ is the bitwise XOR operation.\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1≤n,m≤2⋅105) — the sizes of arrays a and b.\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (0≤ai≤109) — the array a.\nThe third line of each test case contains m integers b1,b2,…,bm (0≤bi≤109) — the array b.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of values of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each test case, output 2 numbers: the minimum and maximum possible values of x after performing any set of operations.\nIn the first test case, if we apply the operation with element b1=1, the array a will become [1,1], and x will be 0. If no operations are applied, then x=1.\nIn the second test case, if no operations are applied, then x=2. If we apply the operation with b1=1, then a=[1,1,3], and x=3.",
