    "description": "You are given an integer array aa of length nn. \nDoes there exist an array bb consisting of n+1n+1 positive integers such that ai=gcd(bi,bi+1)ai=gcd(bi,bi+1) for all ii (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n)? \nNote that gcd(x,y)gcd(x,y) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers xx and yy.\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases tt (1≤t≤1051≤t≤105). Description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer nn (1≤n≤1051≤n≤105) — the length of the array aa.\nThe second line of each test case contains nn space-separated integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an representing the array aa (1≤ai≤1041≤ai≤104).\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 105105.\nFor each test case, output \"YES\" if such bb exists, otherwise output \"NO\". You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\nIn the first test case, we can take b=[343,343]b=[343,343].\nIn the second test case, one possibility for bb is b=[12,8,6]b=[12,8,6].\nIn the third test case, it can be proved that there does not exist any array bb that fulfills all the conditions.",
