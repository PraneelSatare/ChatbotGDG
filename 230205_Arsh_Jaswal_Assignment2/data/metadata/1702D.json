    "description": "Let s be a string of lowercase Latin letters. Its price is the sum of the indices of letters (an integer between 1 and 26) that are included in it. For example, the price of the string abca is 1+2+3+1=7.\nThe string w and the integer p are given. Remove the minimal number of letters from w so that its price becomes less than or equal to p and print the resulting string. Note that the resulting string may be empty. You can delete arbitrary letters, they do not have to go in a row. If the price of a given string w is less than or equal to p, then nothing needs to be deleted and w must be output.\nNote that when you delete a letter from w, the order of the remaining letters is preserved. For example, if you delete the letter e from the string test, you get tst.\nThe first line of input contains an integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases in the test. The following are descriptions of t test cases.\nEach case consists of two lines.\nThe first of them is the string w, it is non-empty and consists of lowercase Latin letters. Its length does not exceed 2⋅105.\nThe second line contains an integer p (1≤p≤5200000).\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of string lengths w over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.\nOutput exactly t rows, the i-th of them should contain the answer to the i-th set of input data. Print the longest string that is obtained from w by deleting letters such that its price is less or equal to p. If there are several answers, then output any of them.\nNote that the empty string  — is one of the possible answers. In this case, just output an empty string.",
