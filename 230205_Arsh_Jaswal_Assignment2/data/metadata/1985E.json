    "description": "Ntarsis has a box B with side lengths x, y, and z. It lies in the 3D coordinate plane, extending from (0,0,0) to (x,y,z). \nNtarsis has a secret box S. He wants to choose its dimensions such that all side lengths are positive integers, and the volume of S is k. He can place S somewhere within B such that: \nS is magical, so when placed at an integer location inside B, it will not fall to the ground. \nAmong all possible ways to choose the dimensions of S, determine the maximum number of distinct locations he can choose to place his secret box S inside B. Ntarsis does not rotate S once its side lengths are selected.\nThe first line consists of an integer t, the number of test cases (1≤t≤2000). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains four integers x,y,z and k (1≤x,y,z≤2000, 1≤k≤x⋅y⋅z).\nIt is guaranteed the sum of all x, sum of all y, and sum of all z do not exceed 2000 over all test cases.\nNote that k may not fit in a standard 32-bit integer data type.\nFor each test case, output the answer as an integer on a new line. If there is no way to select the dimensions of S so it fits in B, output 0.\nFor the first test case, it is optimal to choose S with side lengths 2, 2, and 2, which has a volume of 2⋅2⋅2=8. It can be shown there are 8 ways to put S inside B.\nThe coordinate with the least x, y, and z values for each possible arrangement of S are: \nThe arrangement of S with a coordinate of (0,0,0) is depicted below:\nFor the second test case, S with side lengths 2, 3, and 3 are optimal.",
