    "title": "B. LuoTianyi and the Table",
    "description": "LuoTianyi gave an array b of n⋅m integers. She asks you to construct a table a of size n×m, filled with these n⋅m numbers, and each element of the array must be used exactly once. Also she asked you to maximize the following value:\nThis means that we consider n⋅m subtables with the upper left corner in (1,1) and the bottom right corner in (i,j) (1≤i≤n, 1≤j≤m), for each such subtable calculate the difference of the maximum and minimum elements in it, then sum up all these differences. You should maximize the resulting sum.\nHelp her find the maximal possible value, you don't need to reconstruct the table itself.\nEach test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤200) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (2≤n,m≤100) — the number of rows and columns of the table.\nThe second line of each test case contains n⋅m integers b1,b2,…,bn⋅m (−105≤bi≤105) — the numbers you can put in the table.\nNote, that integers in the array b can be negative.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n⋅m over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximal value, that can be obtained.\nIn the first test case, the table is follows:\n\n\nIn the subtable with the bottom right corner in (1,1), the difference of the maximal and minimal elements is 4−4=0.\nIn the subtable with the bottom right corner in (1,2), the difference of the maximal and minimal elements is 4−1=3.\nIn the subtable with the bottom right corner in (2,1), the difference of the maximal and minimal elements is 4−1=3.\nIn the subtable with the bottom right corner in (2,2), the difference of the maximal and minimal elements is 4−1=3.\nThen the maximum possible value is 0+3+3+3=9.\nIn the second test case, all elements are equal, so all differences are 0, and the answer is 0.",
