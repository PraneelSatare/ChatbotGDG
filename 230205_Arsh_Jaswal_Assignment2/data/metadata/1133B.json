    "description": "International Women's Day is coming soon! Polycarp is preparing for the holiday.\nThere are n candy boxes in the shop for sale. The i-th box contains di candies.\nPolycarp wants to prepare the maximum number of gifts for k girls. Each gift will consist of exactly two boxes. The girls should be able to share each gift equally, so the total amount of candies in a gift (in a pair of boxes) should be divisible by k. In other words, two boxes i and j (i≠j) can be combined as a gift if di+dj is divisible by k.\nHow many boxes will Polycarp be able to give? Of course, each box can be a part of no more than one gift. Polycarp cannot use boxes \"partially\" or redistribute candies between them. \nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1≤n≤2⋅105,1≤k≤100) — the number the boxes and the number the girls.\nThe second line of the input contains n integers d1,d2,…,dn (1≤di≤109), where di is the number of candies in the i-th box.\nPrint one integer — the maximum number of the boxes Polycarp can give as gifts.\nIn the first example Polycarp can give the following pairs of boxes (pairs are presented by indices of corresponding boxes): \nSo the answer is 6.\nIn the second example Polycarp can give the following pairs of boxes (pairs are presented by indices of corresponding boxes): \nSo the answer is 8.\nIn the third example Polycarp can give the following pairs of boxes (pairs are presented by indices of corresponding boxes): \nSo the answer is 4.",
