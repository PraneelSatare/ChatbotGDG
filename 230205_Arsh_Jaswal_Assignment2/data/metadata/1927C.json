    "description": "Given an array a of n integers, an array b of m integers, and an even number k.\nYour task is to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly k2 elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1 to k is included.\nFor example:\nNote that you are not required to find a way to choose the elements — your program should only check whether it is possible to choose the elements in the required way.\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, and k (1≤n,m≤2⋅105, 2≤k≤2⋅min(n,m), k is even) — the length of array a, the length of array b, and the number of elements to be chosen, respectively.\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤106) — the elements of array a.\nThe third line of each test case contains m integers b1,b2,…,bm (1≤bj≤106) — the elements of array b.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test does not exceed 4⋅105.\nOutput t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As the answer, output \"YES\" if it is possible to choose k2 numbers from each array in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1 to k is included. Otherwise, output \"NO\".\nYou can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be accepted as a positive answer.\nIn the first test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal to 2, 3, and 6 from array a and elements equal to 1, 4, and 5 from array b. Thus, all numbers from 1 to k=6 are included among the chosen elements.\nIn the second test case of the example, it can be shown that it is not possible to choose exactly three elements from each array in the required way.\nIn the third test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal to 1 and 3 from array a and elements equal to 2 and 4 from array b. Thus, all numbers from 1 to k=4 are included among the chosen elements.",
