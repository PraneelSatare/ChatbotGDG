    "description": "You are given a positive integer n.\nIn this problem, the MEX of a collection of integers c1,c2,…,ck is defined as the smallest positive integer x which does not occur in the collection c. \nThe primality of an array a1,…,an is defined as the number of pairs (l,r) such that 1≤l≤r≤n and MEX(al,…,ar) is a prime number. \nFind any permutation of 1,2,…,n with the maximum possible primality among all permutations of 1,2,…,n. \nNote: \nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105).\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each test case, output n integers: a permutation of 1,2,…,n that achieves the maximum possible primality.\nIf there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\nIn the first test case, there are 3 pairs (l,r) with 1≤l≤r≤2, out of which 2 have a prime MEX(al,…,ar): \nIn the second test case, MEX(1)=2 is prime, so the primality is 1.\nIn the third test case, the maximum possible primality is 8.",
