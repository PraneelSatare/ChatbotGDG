    "description": "You are given four integers a, b, x and y. Initially, a≥x and b≥y. You can do the following operation no more than n times:\nYour task is to find the minimum possible product of a and b (a⋅b) you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than n times.\nYou have to answer t independent test cases.\nThe first line of the input contains one integer t (1≤t≤2⋅104) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.\nThe only line of the test case contains five integers a, b, x, y and n (1≤a,b,x,y,n≤109). Additional constraint on the input: a≥x and b≥y always holds.\nFor each test case, print one integer: the minimum possible product of a and b (a⋅b) you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than n times.\nIn the first test case of the example, you need to decrease b three times and obtain 10⋅7=70.\nIn the second test case of the example, you need to decrease a one time, b one time and obtain 11⋅7=77.\nIn the sixth test case of the example, you need to decrease a five times and obtain 5⋅11=55.\nIn the seventh test case of the example, you need to decrease b ten times and obtain 10⋅1=10.",
