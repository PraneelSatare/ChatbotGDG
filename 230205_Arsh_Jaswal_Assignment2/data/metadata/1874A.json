    "description": "Jellyfish has n green apples with values a1,a2,…,an and Gellyfish has m green apples with values b1,b2,…,bm.\nThey will play a game with k rounds. For i=1,2,…,k in this order, they will perform the following actions: \nBoth players want to maximize the sum of the values of their apples.\nSince you are one of the smartest people in the world, Jellyfish wants you to tell her the final sum of the value of her apples after all k rounds of the game. Assume that both Jellyfish and Gellyfish play optimally to maximize the sum of values of their apples.\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤2000). The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers, n, m and k (1≤n,m≤50, 1≤k≤109) — the number of green apples Jellyfish has, the number of green apples Gellyfish has and the number of rounds of the game respectively.\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109) — the values of Jellyfish's green apples.\nThe third line of each test case contains m integers b1,b2,…,bm (1≤bi≤109) — the values of Gellyfish's green apples.\nDo note that the sum of n and m over all test cases are both not bounded.\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the final sum of the values of Jellyfish's apples.\nIn the first test case, Jellyfish will swap the apple of value 1 and 4.\nIn the second test case, both players will swap the two apples 10,000 times.\nIn the fourth test case, Jellyfish will do nothing.",
