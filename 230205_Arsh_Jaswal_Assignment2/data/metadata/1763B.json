    "description": "To destroy humanity, The Monster Association sent n monsters to Earth's surface. The i-th monster has health hi and power pi.\nWith his last resort attack, True Spiral Incineration Cannon, Genos can deal k damage to all monsters alive. In other words, Genos can reduce the health of all monsters by k (if k>0) with a single attack. \nHowever, after every attack Genos makes, the monsters advance. With their combined efforts, they reduce Genos' attack damage by the power of the †weakest monster ‡alive. In other words, the minimum pi among all currently living monsters is subtracted from the value of k after each attack.\n†The Weakest monster is the one with the least power.\n‡A monster is alive if its health is strictly greater than 0.\nWill Genos be successful in killing all the monsters?\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers, n and k (1≤n,k≤105) — the number of monsters and Genos' initial attack damage. Then two lines follow, each containing n integers describing the arrays h and p (1≤hi,pi≤109).\nIt's guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each test case, print the answer — \"YES\" (without quotes) if Genos could kill all monsters and \"NO\" otherwise.\nIn the first example, after Genos' first attack, h and k will update to: ",
