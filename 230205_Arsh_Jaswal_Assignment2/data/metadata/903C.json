    "description": "Mishka has got n empty boxes. For every i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), i-th box is a cube with side length ai.\nMishka can put a box i into another box j if the following conditions are met:\nMishka can put boxes into each other an arbitrary number of times. He wants to minimize the number of visible boxes. A box is called visible iff it is not put into some another box.\nHelp Mishka to determine the minimum possible number of visible boxes!\nThe first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) — the number of boxes Mishka has got.\nThe second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109), where ai is the side length of i-th box.\nPrint the minimum possible number of visible boxes.\nIn the first example it is possible to put box 1 into box 2, and 2 into 3.\nIn the second example Mishka can put box 2 into box 3, and box 4 into box 1.",
