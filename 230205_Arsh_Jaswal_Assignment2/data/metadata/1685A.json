    "description": "You are given n integers a1,a2,…,an. Is it possible to arrange them on a circle so that each number is strictly greater than both its neighbors or strictly smaller than both its neighbors?\nIn other words, check if there exists a rearrangement b1,b2,…,bn of the integers a1,a2,…,an such that for each i from 1 to n at least one of the following conditions holds:\nTo make sense of the previous formulas for i=1 and i=n, one shall define b0=bn and bn+1=b1.\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤3⋅104)  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3≤n≤105)  — the number of integers.\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (0≤ai≤109).\nThe sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each test case, if it is not possible to arrange the numbers on the circle satisfying the conditions from the statement, output NO. You can output each letter in any case.\nOtherwise, output YES. In the second line, output n integers b1,b2,…,bn, which are a rearrangement of a1,a2,…,an and satisfy the conditions from the statement. If there are multiple valid ways to arrange the numbers, you can output any of them.\nIt can be shown that there are no valid arrangements for the first and the third test cases.\nIn the second test case, the arrangement [1,8,4,9] works. In this arrangement, 1 and 4 are both smaller than their neighbors, and 8,9 are larger.\nIn the fourth test case, the arrangement [1,11,1,111,1,1111] works. In this arrangement, the three elements equal to 1 are smaller than their neighbors, while all other elements are larger than their neighbors.",
