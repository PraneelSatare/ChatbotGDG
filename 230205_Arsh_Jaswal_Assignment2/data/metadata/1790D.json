    "description": "Matryoshka is a wooden toy in the form of a painted doll, inside which you can put a similar doll of a smaller size.\nA set of nesting dolls contains one or more nesting dolls, their sizes are consecutive positive integers. Thus, a set of nesting dolls is described by two numbers: s — the size of a smallest nesting doll in a set and m — the number of dolls in a set. In other words, the set contains sizes of s,s+1,…,s+m−1 for some integer s and m (s,m>0).\nYou had one or more sets of nesting dolls. Recently, you found that someone mixed all your sets in one and recorded a sequence of doll sizes — integers a1,a2,…,an.\nYou do not remember how many sets you had, so you want to find the minimum number of sets that you could initially have.\nFor example, if a given sequence is a=[2,2,3,4,3,1]. Initially, there could be 2 sets: \nAccording to a given sequence of sizes of nesting dolls a1,a2,…,an, determine the minimum number of nesting dolls that can make this sequence.\nEach set is completely used, so all its nesting dolls are used. Each element of a given sequence must correspond to exactly one doll from some set.\nThe first line of input data contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.\nThe description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — the total number of matryoshkas that were in all sets.\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109)  — the sizes of the matryoshkas. \nIt is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each test case, print one integer k — the minimum possible number of matryoshkas sets.\nThe first test case is described in the problem statement.\nIn the second test case, all matryoshkas could be part of the same set with minimum size s=7.\nIn the third test case, each matryoshka represents a separate set.",
