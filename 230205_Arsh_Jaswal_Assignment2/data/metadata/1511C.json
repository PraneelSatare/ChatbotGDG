    "description": "You have a card deck of n cards, numbered from top to bottom, i. e. the top card has index 1 and bottom card — index n. Each card has its color: the i-th card has color ai.\nYou should process q queries. The j-th query is described by integer tj. For each query you should: \nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2≤n≤3⋅105; 1≤q≤3⋅105) — the number of cards in the deck and the number of queries.\nThe second line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤50) — the colors of cards.\nThe third line contains q integers t1,t2,…,tq (1≤tj≤50) — the query colors. It's guaranteed that queries ask only colors that are present in the deck.\nPrint q integers — the answers for each query.\nDescription of the sample: ",
