    "description": "Suppose a1,a2,…,an is a sorted integer sequence of length n such that a1≤a2≤⋯≤an. \nFor every 1≤i≤n, the prefix sum si of the first i terms a1,a2,…,ai is defined by si=i∑k=1ak=a1+a2+⋯+ai.\nNow you are given the last k terms of the prefix sums, which are sn−k+1,…,sn−1,sn. Your task is to determine whether this is possible. \nFormally, given k integers sn−k+1,…,sn−1,sn, the task is to check whether there is a sequence a1,a2,…,an such that \nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤105) — the number of test cases. The following lines contain the description of each test case.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n (1≤n≤105) and k (1≤k≤n), indicating the length of the sequence a and the number of terms of prefix sums, respectively.\nThe second line of each test case contains k integers sn−k+1,…,sn−1,sn (−109≤si≤109 for every n−k+1≤i≤n).\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 105.\nFor each test case, output \"YES\" (without quotes) if it is possible and \"NO\" (without quotes) otherwise.\nYou can output \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (for example, strings \"yEs\", \"yes\" and \"Yes\" will be recognized as a positive response).\nIn the first test case, we have the only sequence a=[1,1,1,1,1].\nIn the second test case, we can choose, for example, a=[−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3].\nIn the third test case, the prefix sums define the only sequence a=[2,1,1], but it is not sorted. \nIn the fourth test case, it can be shown that there is no sequence with the given prefix sums.",
