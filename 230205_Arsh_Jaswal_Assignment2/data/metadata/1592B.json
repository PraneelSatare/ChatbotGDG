    "description": "Hemose was shopping with his friends Samez, AhmedZ, AshrafEzz, TheSawan and O_E in Germany. As you know, Hemose and his friends are problem solvers, so they are very clever. Therefore, they will go to all discount markets in Germany.\nHemose has an array of n integers. He wants Samez to sort the array in the non-decreasing order. Since it would be a too easy problem for Samez, Hemose allows Samez to use only the following operation:\nChoose indices i and j such that 1≤i,j≤n, and |i−j|≥x. Then, swap elements ai and aj.\nCan you tell Samez if there's a way to sort the array in the non-decreasing order by using the operation written above some finite number of times (possibly 0)?\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤105). Description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1≤x≤n≤105).\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,...,an (1≤ai≤109).\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each test case, you should output a single string. \nIf Samez can sort the array in non-decreasing order using the operation written above, output \"YES\" (without quotes). Otherwise, output \"NO\" (without quotes).\nYou can print each letter of \"YES\" and \"NO\" in any case (upper or lower).\nIn the first test case, you can't do any operations.\nIn the second test case, the array is already sorted.\nIn the third test case, you can do the operations as follows: \n(Here swap(ai,aj) refers to swapping elements at positions i, j).",
