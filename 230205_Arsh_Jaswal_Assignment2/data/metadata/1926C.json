    "description": "Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.\nVladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n, inclusive, on the board. Then he replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.\nWhat is the sum of the numbers on the board now?\nFor example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. Then after the replacement, the numbers become: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3. The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51. Thus, for n=12 the answer is 51.\nThe first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.\nThe only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — the largest number Vladislav writes.\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the end of the process.",
