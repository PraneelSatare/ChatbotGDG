    "description": "During their New Year holidays, Alice and Bob play the following game using an array a of n integers: \nIf there are no numbers left in the array, then the game ends. The player with the highest score wins. If the scores of the players are equal, then a draw is declared.\nFor example, if n=4 and a=[5,2,7,3], then the game could go as follows (there are other options): \nYou want to find out who will win if both players play optimally. Note that there may be duplicate numbers in the array.\nThe first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of elements in the array a.\nThe next line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109) — the array a used to play the game.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each test case, output on a separate line: ",
