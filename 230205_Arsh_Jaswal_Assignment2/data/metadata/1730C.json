    "description": "You have a string s consisting of digits from 0 to 9 inclusive. You can perform the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times: \nWhat is the lexicographically smallest string you can get by performing these operations?\nA string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b of the same length if and only if the following holds: \nThe first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nEach test case consists of a single line that contains one string s (1≤|s|≤2⋅105) — the string consisting of digits. Please note that s is just a string consisting of digits, so leading zeros are allowed.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of s over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.\nPrint a single string — the minimum string that is possible to obtain.\nIn the first test case: \nNothing needs to be done in the second and third test cases.",
