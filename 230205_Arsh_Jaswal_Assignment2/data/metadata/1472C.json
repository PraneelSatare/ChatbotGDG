    "description": "Polycarp found under the Christmas tree an array a of n elements and instructions for playing with it: \nFor example, if n=5 and a=[7,3,1,2,3], then the following game options are possible: \nHelp Polycarp to find out the maximum score he can get if he chooses the starting index in an optimal way.\nThe first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of the array a.\nThe next line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109) — elements of the array a.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each test case, output on a separate line one number — the maximum score that Polycarp can get by playing the game on the corresponding array according to the instruction from the statement. Note that Polycarp chooses any starting position from 1 to n in such a way as to maximize his result.\nThe first test case is explained in the statement.\nIn the second test case, the maximum score can be achieved by choosing i=1.\nIn the third test case, the maximum score can be achieved by choosing i=2.\nIn the fourth test case, the maximum score can be achieved by choosing i=1.",
