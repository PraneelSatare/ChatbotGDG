    "description": "You are given an array a1,a2,…,an, where all elements are different.\nYou have to perform exactly k operations with it. During each operation, you do exactly one of the following two actions (you choose which to do yourself):\nYou have to calculate the maximum possible sum of elements in the resulting array.\nThe first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of two lines: \nAdditional constraint on the input: the sum of n does not exceed 2⋅105.\nFor each test case, print one integer — the maximum possible sum of elements in the resulting array.\nIn the first testcase, applying the first operation produces the following outcome: \n21 is the best answer.\nIn the second testcase, it's optimal to first erase two minimums, then a maximum.",
