Chaneka, a gamer kid, invented a new gaming controller called joyboard. Interestingly, the joyboard she invented can only be used to play one game.
The joyboard has a screen containing n+1 slots numbered from 1 to n+1 from left to right. The n+1 slots are going to be filled with an array of non-negative integers [a1,a2,a3,…,an+1]. Chaneka, as the player, must assign an+1 with an integer between 0 and m inclusive. Then, for each i from n to 1, the value of ai will be equal to the remainder of dividing ai+1 (the adjacent value to the right) by i. In other words, ai=ai+1modi.
Chaneka wants it such that after every slot is assigned with an integer, there are exactly k distinct values in the entire screen (among all n+1 slots). How many valid ways are there for assigning a non-negative integer into slot n+1?
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤2⋅104) — the number of test cases. The following lines contain the description of each test case.
The only line of each test case contains three integers n, m, and k (1≤n≤109; 0≤m≤109; 1≤k≤n+1) — there are n+1 slots, the integer assigned in slot n+1 must not be bigger than m, and there should be exactly k distinct values.
For each test case, output a line containing an integer representing the number of valid ways for assigning a non-negative integer into slot n+1.
In the first test case, one of the 2 possible ways for Chaneka is to choose an+1=6. If she does that, then: 
In the second test case, the 1 possible way for Chaneka is to choose an+1=0. If she does that, then a=[0,0,0]. There is only 1 distinct value.
In the third test case, there is no possible way for assigning a non-negative integer into slot n+1.
