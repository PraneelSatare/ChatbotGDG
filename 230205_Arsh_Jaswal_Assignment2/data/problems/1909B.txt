You are given an array a1,a2,…,an of distinct positive integers. You have to do the following operation exactly once:
Find a value of k such that 1≤k≤1018 and the array a1,a2,…,an contains exactly 2 distinct values at the end of the operation. It can be shown that, under the constraints of the problem, at least one such k always exists. If there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them.
† a mod b denotes the remainder after dividing a by b. For example: 
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤500). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2≤n≤100) — the length of the array a.
The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1017) — the initial state of the array. It is guaranteed that all the ai are distinct.
Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.
For each test case, output a single integer: a value of k (1≤k≤1018) such that the array a1,a2,…,an contains exactly 2 distinct values at the end of the operation.
In the first test case, you can choose k=7. The array becomes [8 mod 7,15 mod 7,22 mod 7,30 mod 7]=[1,1,1,2], which contains exactly 2 distinct values ({1,2}).
In the second test case, you can choose k=30. The array becomes [0,0,8,0,8], which contains exactly 2 distinct values ({0,8}). Note that choosing k=10 would also be a valid solution.
In the last test case, you can choose k=1018. The array becomes [2,1], which contains exactly 2 distinct values ({1,2}). Note that choosing k=1018+1 would not be valid, because 1≤k≤1018 must be true.
