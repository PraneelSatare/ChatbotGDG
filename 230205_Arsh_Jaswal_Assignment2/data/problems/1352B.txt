You are given two positive integers n (1≤n≤109) and k (1≤k≤100). Represent the number n as the sum of k positive integers of the same parity (have the same remainder when divided by 2).
In other words, find a1,a2,…,ak such that all ai>0, n=a1+a2+…+ak and either all ai are even or all ai are odd at the same time.
If such a representation does not exist, then report it.
The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases in the input. Next, t test cases are given, one per line.
Each test case is two positive integers n (1≤n≤109) and k (1≤k≤100).
For each test case print:
The letters in the words YES and NO can be printed in any case.
