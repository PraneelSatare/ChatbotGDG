You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n monsters trying to kill your character; the i-th monster has health equal to ai and is initially in the point xi.
Every second, the following happens:
Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your character?
The first line of the input contains one integer t (1≤t≤3⋅104) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of three lines:
Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105.
For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach your character, or NO otherwise.
You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive responses.
In the first example, you can act as follows:
In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of the two monsters during the 1-st second. Then, the remaining monster moves closer and kills your character.
