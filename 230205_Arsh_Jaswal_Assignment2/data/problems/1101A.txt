You are given q queries in the following form:
Given three integers li, ri and di, find minimum positive integer xi such that it is divisible by di and it does not belong to the segment [li,ri].
Can you answer all the queries?
Recall that a number x belongs to segment [l,r] if l≤x≤r.
The first line contains one integer q (1≤q≤500) — the number of queries.
Then q lines follow, each containing a query given in the format li ri di (1≤li≤ri≤109, 1≤di≤109). li, ri and di are integers.
For each query print one integer: the answer to this query.
