Consider the set of all nonnegative integers: 0,1,2,…. Given two integers a and b (1≤a,b≤104). We paint all the numbers in increasing number first we paint 0, then we paint 1, then 2 and so on.
Each number is painted white or black. We paint a number i according to the following rules: 
In this way, each nonnegative integer gets one of two colors.
For example, if a=3, b=5, then the colors of the numbers (in the order from 0) are: white (0), black (1), black (2), white (3), black (4), white (5), white (6), black (7), white (8), white (9), ...
Note that: 
Your task is to determine whether or not the number of nonnegative integers colored black is infinite.
If there are infinitely many nonnegative integers colored black, simply print a line containing "Infinite" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print "Finite" (without the quotes).
The first line of input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases in the input. Then t lines follow, each line contains two space-separated integers a and b (1≤a,b≤104).
For each test case, print one line containing either "Infinite" or "Finite" (without the quotes). Output is case-insensitive (i.e. "infinite", "inFiNite" or "finiTE" are all valid answers).
