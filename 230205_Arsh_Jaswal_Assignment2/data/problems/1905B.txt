You are given a tree†. In one zelda-operation you can do follows:
Determine the minimum number of zelda-operations required for the tree to have only one vertex.
†A tree is a connected acyclic undirected graph.
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2≤n≤105) — the number of vertices.
i-th of the next n−1 lines contains two integers ui and vi (1≤ui,vi≤n,ui≠vi) — the numbers of vertices connected by the i-th edge.
It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 105.
For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of zelda-operations required for the tree to have only one vertex.
In the first test case, it's enough to perform one zelda-operation for vertices 2 and 4.
In the second test case, we can perform the following zelda-operations:
