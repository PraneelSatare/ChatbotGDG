You are given two integers x and y. You can perform two types of operations: 
 
Your goal is to make both given integers equal zero simultaneously, i.e. x=y=0. There are no other requirements. In particular, it is possible to move from x=1, y=0 to x=y=0.
Calculate the minimum amount of dollars you have to spend on it.
The first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of testcases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0≤x,y≤109).
The second line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1≤a,b≤109).
For each test case print one integer — the minimum amount of dollars you have to spend.
In the first test case you can perform the following sequence of operations: first, second, first. This way you spend 391+555+391=1337 dollars.
In the second test case both integers are equal to zero initially, so you dont' have to spend money.
