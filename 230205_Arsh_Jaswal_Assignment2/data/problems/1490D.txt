A permutation — is a sequence of length n integers from 1 to n, in which all the numbers occur exactly once. For example, [1], [3,5,2,1,4], [1,3,2] — permutations, and [2,3,2], [4,3,1], [0] — no.
Polycarp was recently gifted a permutation a[1…n] of length n. Polycarp likes trees more than permutations, so he wants to transform permutation a into a rooted binary tree. He transforms an array of different integers into a tree as follows: 
For example, if he builds a tree by permutation a=[3,5,2,1,4], then the root will be the element a2=5, and the left subtree will be the tree that will be built for the subarray a[1…1]=[3], and the right one — for the subarray a[3…5]=[2,1,4]. As a result, the following tree will be built: 
Another example: let the permutation be a=[1,3,2,7,5,6,4]. In this case, the tree looks like this: 
Let us denote by dv the depth of the vertex av, that is, the number of edges on the path from the root to the vertex numbered av. Note that the root depth is zero. Given the permutation a, for each vertex, find the value of dv.
The first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1≤n≤100) — the length of the permutation.
This is followed by n numbers a1,a2,…,an — permutation a.
For each test case, output n values — d1,d2,…,dn.
