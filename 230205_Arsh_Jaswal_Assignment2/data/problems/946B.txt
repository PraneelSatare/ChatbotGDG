You have two variables a and b. Consider the following sequence of actions performed with these variables:
Initially the values of a and b are positive integers, and so the process will be finite.
You have to determine the values of a and b after the process ends.
The only line of the input contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1018). n is the initial value of variable a, and m is the initial value of variable b.
Print two integers — the values of a and b after the end of the process.
