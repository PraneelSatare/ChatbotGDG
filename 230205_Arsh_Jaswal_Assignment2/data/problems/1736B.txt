You are given an integer array aa of length nn. 
Does there exist an array bb consisting of n+1n+1 positive integers such that ai=gcd(bi,bi+1)ai=gcd(bi,bi+1) for all ii (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n)? 
Note that gcd(x,y)gcd(x,y) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers xx and yy.
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases tt (1≤t≤1051≤t≤105). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer nn (1≤n≤1051≤n≤105) — the length of the array aa.
The second line of each test case contains nn space-separated integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an representing the array aa (1≤ai≤1041≤ai≤104).
It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 105105.
For each test case, output "YES" if such bb exists, otherwise output "NO". You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).
In the first test case, we can take b=[343,343]b=[343,343].
In the second test case, one possibility for bb is b=[12,8,6]b=[12,8,6].
In the third test case, it can be proved that there does not exist any array bb that fulfills all the conditions.
