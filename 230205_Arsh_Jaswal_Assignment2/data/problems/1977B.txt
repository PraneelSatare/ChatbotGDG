You are given a positive integer x. Find any array of integers a0,a1,…,an−1 for which the following holds: 
It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array always exists.
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1≤x<230).
For each test case, output two lines.
On the first line, output an integer n (1≤n≤32) — the length of the array a0,a1,…,an−1.
On the second line, output the array a0,a1,…,an−1.
If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.
In the first test case, one valid array is [1], since (1)⋅20=1.
In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,−1,0,0,1], since (0)⋅20+(−1)⋅21+(0)⋅22+(0)⋅23+(1)⋅24=−2+16=14.
