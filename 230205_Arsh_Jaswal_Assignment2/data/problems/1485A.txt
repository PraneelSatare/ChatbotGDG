You have two positive integers a and b.
You can perform two kinds of operations:
Find the minimum number of operations required to make a=0.
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases.
The only line of the description of each test case contains two integers a, b (1≤a,b≤109).
For each test case, print a single integer: the minimum number of operations required to make a=0.
In the first test case, one of the optimal solutions is:
