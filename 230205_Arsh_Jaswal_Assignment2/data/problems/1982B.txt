Recently, the first-year student Maxim learned about the Collatz conjecture, but he didn't pay much attention during the lecture, so he believes that the following process is mentioned in the conjecture:
There is a variable x and a constant y. The following operation is performed k times: 
For example, if the number x=16, y=3, and k=2, then after one operation x becomes 17, and after another operation x becomes 2, because after adding one, x=18 is divisible by 3 twice.
Given the initial values of x, y, and k, Maxim wants to know what is the final value of x.
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases.
The only line of each test case contains three integers x, y, and k (1≤x,k≤109, 2≤y≤109) — the initial variable, constant and the number of operations.
For each test case, output a single integer — the number obtained after applying k operations.
In the first test case, there is only one operation applied to x=1, resulting in x becoming 2.
In the second test case, for x=2, within one operation, one is added to x and it's divided by y=3, resulting in x becoming 1.
In the third test case, x changes as follows:
