You went to the store, selling n types of chocolates. There are ai chocolates of type i in stock.
You have unlimited amount of cash (so you are not restricted by any prices) and want to buy as many chocolates as possible. However if you buy xi chocolates of type i (clearly, 0≤xi≤ai), then for all 1≤j<i at least one of the following must hold:
For example, the array x=[0,0,1,2,10] satisfies the requirement above (assuming that all ai≥xi), while arrays x=[0,1,0], x=[5,5] and x=[3,2] don't.
Calculate the maximum number of chocolates you can buy.
The first line contains an integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105), denoting the number of types of chocolate.
The next line contains n integers ai (1≤ai≤109), denoting the number of chocolates of each type.
Print the maximum number of chocolates you can buy.
In the first example, it is optimal to buy: 0+0+1+3+6 chocolates.
In the second example, it is optimal to buy: 1+2+3+4+10 chocolates.
In the third example, it is optimal to buy: 0+0+0+1 chocolates.
