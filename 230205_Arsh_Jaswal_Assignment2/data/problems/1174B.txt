You're given an array a of length n. You can perform the following operation on it as many times as you want:
What is lexicographically the smallest array you can obtain?
An array x is lexicographically smaller than an array y if there exists an index i such that xi<yi, and xj=yj for all 1≤j<i. Less formally, at the first index i in which they differ, xi<yi
The first line contains an integer n (1≤n≤105) — the number of elements in the array a.
The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, …, an (1≤ai≤109) — the elements of the array a.
The only line contains n space-separated integers, the lexicographically smallest array you can obtain.
In the first example, we can swap 1 and 4 since 1+4=5, which is odd.
