You have an array aa of nn non-negative integers. Let's define f(a,x)=[a1modx,a2modx,…,anmodx]f(a,x)=[a1modx,a2modx,…,anmodx] for some positive integer xx. Find the biggest xx, such that f(a,x)f(a,x) is a palindrome.
Here, amodxamodx is the remainder of the integer division of aa by xx.
An array is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. More formally, an array aa of length nn is a palindrome if for every ii (1≤i≤n1≤i≤n) ai=an−i+1ai=an−i+1.
The first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤1051≤t≤105) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1≤n≤1051≤n≤105).
The second line of each test case contains nn integers aiai (0≤ai≤1090≤ai≤109).
It's guaranteed that the sum of all nn does not exceed 105105.
For each test case output the biggest xx, such that f(a,x)f(a,x) is a palindrome. If xx can be infinitely large, output 00 instead.
In the first example, f(a,x=1)=[0,0]f(a,x=1)=[0,0] which is a palindrome.
In the second example, f(a,x=2)=[1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1]f(a,x=2)=[1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1] which is a palindrome.
It can be proven that in the first two examples, no larger xx satisfies the condition.
In the third example, f(a,x)=[0]f(a,x)=[0] for any xx, so we can choose it infinitely large, so the answer is 00.
