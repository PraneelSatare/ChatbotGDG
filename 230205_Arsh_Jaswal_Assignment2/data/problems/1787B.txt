Given an integer n.
Consider all pairs of integer arrays a and p of the same length such that n=∏apii (i.e. ap11⋅ap22⋅…) (ai>1;pi>0) and ai is the product of some (possibly one) distinct prime numbers.
For example, for n=28=22⋅71=41⋅71 the array pair a=[2,7], p=[2,1] is correct, but the pair of arrays a=[4,7], p=[1,1] is not, because 4=22 is a product of non-distinct prime numbers.
Your task is to find the maximum value of ∑ai⋅pi (i.e. a1⋅p1+a2⋅p2+…) over all possible pairs of arrays a and p. Note that you do not need to minimize or maximize the length of the arrays.
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases. 
Each test case contains only one integer n (2≤n≤109).
For each test case, print the maximum value of ∑ai⋅pi.
In the first test case, 100=102 so that a=[10], p=[2] when ∑ai⋅pi hits the maximum value 10⋅2=20. Also, a=[100], p=[1] does not work since 100 is not made of distinct prime factors.
In the second test case, we can consider 10 as 101, so a=[10], p=[1]. Notice that when 10=21⋅51, ∑ai⋅pi=7.
