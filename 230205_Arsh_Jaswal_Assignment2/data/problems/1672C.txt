You are given an array a of length n. We define the equality of the array as the number of indices 1≤i≤n−1 such that ai=ai+1. We are allowed to do the following operation:
Find the minimum number of operations needed such that the equality of the array is less than or equal to 1.
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer n (2≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of array a.
The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109) — elements of the array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105
For each test case, print the minimum number of operations needed.
In the first test case, we can select i=2 and x=2 to form [1,2,2,1,1]. Then, we can select i=3 and x=3 to form [1,2,3,3,1].
In the second test case, we can select i=3 and x=100 to form [2,1,100,100,2].
