While at Kira's house, Josuke saw a piece of paper on the table with a task written on it.
The task sounded as follows. There is an array a of length n. On this array, do the following:
The task is to find such a partition that the score is maximum possible. Josuke is interested in this task but is not strong in computer science. Help him to find the maximum possible score.
† A division of an array into k subsegments is k pairs of numbers (l1,r1),(l2,r2),…,(lk,rk) such that li≤ri and for every 1≤j≤k−1 lj+1=rj+1, also l1=1 and rk=n. These pairs represent the subsegments.
‡ gcd(b1,b2,…,bk) stands for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the array b.
The first line contains a single number t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.
For each test case, the first line contains one integer n (2≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of the array a.
The second line contains n integers a1,a2,a3,…,an (1≤ai≤109) — the array a itself.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.
For each test case print a single integer — the maximum score for the optimal partition.
In the first test case, you can choose k=2 and split the array into subsegments (1,2) and (3,4).
Then the score of such a partition will be equal to gcd(a1+a2,a3+a4)=gcd(2+2,1+3)=gcd(4,4)=4.
In the fourth test case, you can choose k=3 and split the array into subsegments (1,2),(3,5),(6,6).
The split score is gcd(1+2,1+1+1,3)=3.
