Polycarp found under the Christmas tree an array a of n elements and instructions for playing with it: 
For example, if n=5 and a=[7,3,1,2,3], then the following game options are possible: 
Help Polycarp to find out the maximum score he can get if he chooses the starting index in an optimal way.
The first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains one integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of the array a.
The next line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109) — elements of the array a.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.
For each test case, output on a separate line one number — the maximum score that Polycarp can get by playing the game on the corresponding array according to the instruction from the statement. Note that Polycarp chooses any starting position from 1 to n in such a way as to maximize his result.
The first test case is explained in the statement.
In the second test case, the maximum score can be achieved by choosing i=1.
In the third test case, the maximum score can be achieved by choosing i=2.
In the fourth test case, the maximum score can be achieved by choosing i=1.
