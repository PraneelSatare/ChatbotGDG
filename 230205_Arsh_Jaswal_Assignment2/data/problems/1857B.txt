Given a natural number x. You can perform the following operation: 
Note that the positions are numbered from right to left, starting from zero. If the number has k digits, it is considered that the digit at the k-th position is equal to 0.
The rounding is done as follows: 
 
 
Your task is to make x as large as possible, if you can perform the operation as many times as you want.
For example, if x is equal to 3451, then if you choose consecutively: 
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of positive integer x with a length of up to 2⋅105. It is guaranteed that there are no leading zeros in the integer.
It is guaranteed that the sum of the lengths of all integers x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.
For each set of input data, output the maximum possible value of x after the operations. The number should not have leading zeros in its representation.
In the first sample, it is better not to perform any operations.
In the second sample, you can perform one operation and obtain 10.
In the third sample, you can choose k=1 or k=2. In both cases the answer will be 100.
