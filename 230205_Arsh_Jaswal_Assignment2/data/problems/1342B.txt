Let's say string s has period k if si=si+k for all i from 1 to |s|−k (|s| means length of string s) and k is the minimum positive integer with this property.
Some examples of a period: for s="0101" the period is k=2, for s="0000" the period is k=1, for s="010" the period is k=2, for s="0011" the period is k=4.
You are given string t consisting only of 0's and 1's and you need to find such string s that:
Let us recall that t is a subsequence of s if t can be derived from s by deleting zero or more elements (any) without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, t="011" is a subsequence of s="10101".
The first line contains single integer T (1≤T≤100) — the number of test cases.
Next T lines contain test cases — one per line. Each line contains string t (1≤|t|≤100) consisting only of 0's and 1's.
Print one string for each test case — string s you needed to find. If there are multiple solutions print any one of them.
In the first and second test cases, s=t since it's already one of the optimal solutions. Answers have periods equal to 1 and 2, respectively.
In the third test case, there are shorter optimal solutions, but it's okay since we don't need to minimize the string s. String s has period equal to 1.
