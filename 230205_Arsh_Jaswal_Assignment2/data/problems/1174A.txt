You're given an array a of length 2n. Is it possible to reorder it in such way so that the sum of the first n elements isn't equal to the sum of the last n elements?
The first line contains an integer n (1≤n≤1000), where 2n is the number of elements in the array a.
The second line contains 2n space-separated integers a1, a2, …, a2n (1≤ai≤106) — the elements of the array a.
If there's no solution, print "-1" (without quotes). Otherwise, print a single line containing 2n space-separated integers. They must form a reordering of a. You are allowed to not change the order.
In the first example, the first n elements have sum 2+1+3=6 while the last n elements have sum 1+1+2=4. The sums aren't equal.
In the second example, there's no solution.
