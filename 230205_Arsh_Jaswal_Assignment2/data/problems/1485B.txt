Given a positive integer k, two arrays are called k-similar if:
You are given an integer k, a strictly increasing array a and q queries. For each query, you are given two integers li≤ri. Your task is to find how many arrays b exist, such that b is k-similar to array [ali,ali+1…,ari]. 
The first line contains three integers n, q and k (1≤n,q≤105, n≤k≤109) — the length of array a, the number of queries and number k.
The second line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤k). This array is strictly increasing  — a1<a2<…<an.
Each of the following q lines contains two integers li, ri (1≤li≤ri≤n).
Print q lines. The i-th of them should contain the answer to the i-th query.
In the first example:
In the first query there are 4 arrays that are 5-similar to [2,4]: [1,4],[3,4],[2,3],[2,5].
In the second query there are 3 arrays that are 5-similar to [4,5]: [1,5],[2,5],[3,5].
