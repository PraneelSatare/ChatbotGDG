The Fair Nut lives in n story house. ai people live on the i-th floor of the house. Every person uses elevator twice a day: to get from the floor where he/she lives to the ground (first) floor and to get from the first floor to the floor where he/she lives, when he/she comes back home in the evening. 
It was decided that elevator, when it is not used, will stay on the x-th floor, but x hasn't been chosen yet. When a person needs to get from floor a to floor b, elevator follows the simple algorithm: 
Your task is to help Nut to find the minimum number of electricity units, that it would be enough for one day, by choosing an optimal the x-th floor. Don't forget than elevator initially stays on the x-th floor. 
The first line contains one integer n (1≤n≤100) — the number of floors.
The second line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (0≤ai≤100) — the number of people on each floor.
In a single line, print the answer to the problem — the minimum number of electricity units.
In the first example, the answer can be achieved by choosing the second floor as the x-th floor. Each person from the second floor (there are two of them) would spend 4 units of electricity per day (2 to get down and 2 to get up), and one person from the third would spend 8 units of electricity per day (4 to get down and 4 to get up). 4⋅2+8⋅1=16.
In the second example, the answer can be achieved by choosing the first floor as the x-th floor.
