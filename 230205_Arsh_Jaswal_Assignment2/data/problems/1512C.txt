You are given a string s consisting of the characters '0', '1', and '?'. You need to replace all the characters with '?' in the string s by '0' or '1' so that the string becomes a palindrome and has exactly a characters '0' and exactly b characters '1'. Note that each of the characters '?' is replaced independently from the others.
A string t of length n is called a palindrome if the equality t[i]=t[n−i+1] is true for all i (1≤i≤n).
For example, if s="01?????0", a=4 and b=4, then you can replace the characters '?' in the following ways: 
For the given string s and the numbers a and b, replace all the characters with '?' in the string s by '0' or '1' so that the string becomes a palindrome and has exactly a characters '0' and exactly b characters '1'.
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104). Then t test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers a and b (0≤a,b≤2⋅105, a+b≥1).
The second line of each test case contains the string s of length a+b, consisting of the characters '0', '1', and '?'.
It is guaranteed that the sum of the string lengths of s over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.
For each test case, output: 
If there are several suitable ways to replace characters, you can output any.
