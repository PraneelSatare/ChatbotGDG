Tanya is learning how to add numbers, but so far she is not doing it correctly. She is adding two numbers a and b using the following algorithm:
For example, the numbers a=17236 and b=3465 Tanya adds up as follows:
+17236034651106911
As a result, she gets 1106911.
You are given two positive integers a and s. Find the number b such that by adding a and b as described above, Tanya will get s. Or determine that no suitable b exists.
The first line of input data contains an integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line containing two positive integers a and s (1≤a<s≤1018) separated by a space.
For each test case print the answer on a separate line.
If the solution exists, print a single positive integer b. The answer must be written without leading zeros. If multiple answers exist, print any of them.
If no suitable number b exists, output -1.
The first test case is explained in the main part of the statement.
In the third test case, we cannot choose b that satisfies the problem statement.
