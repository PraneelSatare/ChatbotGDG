    "solution": "1808B - Playing in a CasinoYou may notice that the problem can be solved independently for each column of the input matrix. The answer is then the sum ∑i=1n∑j=i+1n|ai−aj|, where a — array representing a column.Let's try to calculate this sum for each column. Let's sort all elements of the current column. Let's calculate the answer for some element in the sorted list. The answer for it will be ai⋅i−sum, where sum is the sum on the prefix. Why is this so? Because we say that this number is larger than the others and the modulus will then decompose as ai−aj, and this is already easy to count."
