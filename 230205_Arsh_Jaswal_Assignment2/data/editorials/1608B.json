    "solution": "1608B - Build the PermutationFirst, answer does not exists if a+b+2>n.Second, answer exists if and only if |a−b|≤1.It happens because between every two consecutive local maximums must be exactly one local minimum. And vice versa, between two consecutive minimums must be exactly one maximum. First case gives b≥a−1, second — a≥b−1, both in total gives a−1≤b≤a+1.Lets build answer considering a≥b. Otherwise we can build inverse answer: swap a and b, and perform replace pi=n−pi+1.Lets take a+b+2 biggest numbers (i. e. from n downto n−a−b−1) and put them consequentially, such numbers on first position and on each second position from first are less then other numbers. It gives that every number, except first and last, are local maximum or local minimum. Rest of the numbers needed to be placed before this sequence in increasing order.Author: TadijaSebez "
