    "solution": "899B - Months and YearsNote, that n ≤ 24, so we should consider the following cycle: not leap-year — leap-year — not leap-year — not leap-year. This cycle repeats every 4 years, except in some cases. We should generate an array describing the duration of the months in the described cycle. After that we should check that the given sequence can be found in the generated array. For example, we can brute the beginning of the sequence in the array and check the correspondence of the elements of the given sequence to the corresponding elements of the generated array. "
