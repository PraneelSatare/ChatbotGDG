1834C - Game with ReversingLet's show that the specific choice of a turn by Bob (which of the strings to reverse) does not affect Alice's strategy and therefore the answer to the problem.Reversing the string twice does not change anything → we are only interested in the parity of the number of reverses for both strings.If Bob made an even number of moves in total, then the parity of the number of moves made by Bob with string s coincides with the parity of the number of moves made by Bob with string t→ pairs of characters at the same indices, after all reverses, will be (s1,t1),(s2,t2),…,(sn,tn), possibly in reverse order, but it doesn't matter. Here s1,…,sn and t1,…,tn are the original indices of the strings, which do not change with reversing.If Bob made an odd number of moves, then exactly one of the strings will be reversed, and the pairs of characters in the same indices will be: (s1,tn),(s2,tn−1),…,(sn,t1) (or in reverse order).That is, the specific pairs of corresponding characters are determined only by the parity of the total number of moves made by Bob, and it does not matter which specific moves were made.Therefore, Alice can choose one of two strategies: Make s1=t1,s2=t2,…,sn=tn, and fix the end of the game when the number of moves made by Bob is even. Make s1=tn,s2=tn−1,…,sn=t1, and fix the end of the game when the number of moves made by Bob is odd.Let's count cnt — the number of indices where s and t differ, and cntrev — the number of indices where s and rev(t) differ.For the first strategy, Alice must make at least cnt moves herself, and it is also necessary that the number of moves made by Bob is even → it is easy to see that for this strategy the game will last 2⋅cnt−cnt%2 moves.For the second strategy, everything is roughly similar: the game will last 2⋅cntrev−(1−cntrev%2) moves, but the case cntrev=0 needs to be handled separately.And the answer to the problem will be the minimum of these two values. Asymptotic: O(n).
