    "solution": "1342A - Road To ZeroLet's presume that $$$x \\ge y$$$. Then there are two cases in the problem:   If $$$a + a \\le b$$$ then we have to $$$x + y$$$ times perform the first operation. So the answer is $$$(x + y) \\cdot a$$$;  If $$$a + a > b$$$ then we have to $$$y$$$ times perform the second operation and pass the remaining distance by performing the first operation. So the answer is $$$y \\cdot b + (x - y) \\cdot a$$$.  Solution (Roms)for _ in range(int(input())):\n    x, y = map(int, input().split())\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n    b = min(b, a + a)\n    if x < y:\n        x, y= y, x\n    print(y * b + (x - y) * a)"
