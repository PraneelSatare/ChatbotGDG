    "solution": "1149A. Prefix Sum Primes Tutorial1150C - Prefix Sum PrimesThere are at least a couple of correct solutions I had in mind. Let me present the one I find the most straightforward, which doesn't even require implementing any sieve.If all the numbers on the tiles are equal, we have no choice but to output the only possible permutation. In the remaining cases, we'll show that the following solution is optimal:  Start with 2 and 1.  Use all remaining 2s.  Finish with all remaining 1s.  It's easy to see that we generate 2 and all odd numbers between 3 and ∑ni=1ai as the prefix sums. Notice now that each prime is either 2 or an odd number greater than or equal to 3. Therefore, using the construction above we construct all possible prime prefix sums we possibly can — and so the construction is optimal. The solution can be implemented easily in O(n) time.
