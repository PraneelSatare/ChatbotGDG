1485B - Replace and Keep SortedAuthor: TheScrasse Preparation: Kaey Hint 1You can make a k-similar array by assigning ai=x for some l≤i≤r and 1≤x≤k.  Hint 2How many k-similar arrays can you make if x is already equal to some ai (l≤i≤r)? Hint 3How many k-similar arrays can you make if either x<al or x>ar? Hint 4How many k-similar arrays can you make if none of the previous conditions holds? SolutionLet's consider each value x from 1 to k.  If x<al, you can replace al with x (and you get 1 k-similar array). There are al−1 such values of x. If x>ar, you can replace ar with x (and you get 1 k-similar array). There are k−ar such values of x. If al<x<ar, and x≠ai for all i in [l,r], you can either replace the rightmost bi which is less than x, or the leftmost bi which is greater than x (and you get 2 k-similar arrays). There are (ar−al+1)−(r−l+1) such values of x. If x=ai for some i in [l,r], no k-similar arrays can be made. The total count is (al−1)+(k−ar)+2((ar−al+1)−(r−l+1)), which simplifies to k+(ar−al+1)−2(r−l+1).Complexity: O(n+q).Official solution: 107232462
