1200B - Block AdventureWe can easily see that it's always optimal to have as many blocks as possible in the bag before getting to the next column. Therefore, if the character is currently on the top of the i-th column, Gildong just needs to make hi become max(0,hi+1−k) by repeating the 1-st or the 2-nd action. In other words, we should add hi−max(0,hi+1−k) blocks to the bag. Adding or subtracting one by one will lead to TLE. If there exists a situation where the bag will have negative number of blocks, the answer is NO. Otherwise the answer is YES.Time complexity: O(n) for each test case.
