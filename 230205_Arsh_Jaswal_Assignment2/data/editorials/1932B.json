They will expect the second event in some year x>a1, which is divisible by a2, this will happen after a2−a1moda2 years. Let's maintain the number cur of the year in which the i-th sign occurred, then the (i+1)-th will occur in the year cur+ai+1−curmodai+1. Since this is the smallest year number divisible by ai+1, which is strictly greater than cur.
