    "solution": "1300B - Assigning to ClassesLet's sort the array. From now on, a1≤a2⋯≤a2n.Consider any partition. Suppose that the first class has 2k+1 students, and the skill level of this class is ai, and the second class had 2l+1 students, and the skill level of this class is aj, where (2k+1)+(2l+1)=2n⟹k+l=n−1. Without losing generality, i<j. At least n+1 students have skill level at least ai. Indeed, as ai is a median of his class, he and k other students have skill level at least ai. As aj≥ai and at least l other students of the second class have skill level at least aj≥ai, we get at least k+l+2=n+1 students (including ai) with skill level at least ai. Therefore, ai≤an.Similarly, we get that at least n+1 students have skill level at most aj. Therefore, aj≥an+1.So, |aj−ai|≥an+1−an. However, an+1−an is achievable. Let's put student an into the class alone, and all other students into other class. an+1 will be the median skill level of that class, so the absolute difference will be exactly an+1−an.Therefore, it's enough to sort the array and to output the difference between two middle elements.
