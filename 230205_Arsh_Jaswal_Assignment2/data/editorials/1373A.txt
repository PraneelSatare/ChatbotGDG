1373A - Donut ShopsAt first notice that if there exists a value for the second shop, then the value divisible by b also exists. For any x you can round it up to the nearest multiple of b. That won't change the price for the second shop and only increase the price for the first shop.You can also guess that if there exists a value for the first shop, then the value with 1 modulo b also exists (exactly 1 donut on top of some number of full boxes). Following the same logic — the second shop needs an entire new box and the first shop needs only an extra donut.So let's take a look at the smallest values of two kinds:   x=b: this value is valid for the second shop if one box is cheaper than b donuts in the first shop. Otherwise, no matter how many boxes will you take, they will never be cheaper than the corresponding number of donuts.  x=1: this value is valid for the first shop if one donut is cheaper than one box in the second shop. Apply the same idea — otherwise no value for the first shop is valid. Overall complexity: O(1) per testcase. Solution (pikmike)for tc in range(int(input())):
	a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
	print(1 if a < c else -1, end=" ")
	print(b if c < a * b else -1)
