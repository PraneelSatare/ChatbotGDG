    "solution": "1690D - Black and White StripeTo obtain a segment of k cells of black color, we need to paint all the white cells of the segment black. Then go through all the segments of length k (there are only nâˆ’k) and choose such a segment among them that the number of white cells on it is minimal. You can quickly find out the number of white cells in the segment by prefix sums.
