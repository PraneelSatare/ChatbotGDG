As 1+3>2, any two numbers with same parity sum up to a composite number. Now you only have to find one odd number and one even number that sum up to a composite number. One can manually verify that there is no such pair in nâ‰¤4, but in n=5 there exists (4,5) which sums up to 9, a composite number. Code (Python) for _ in range(int(input())):\n    n = int(input())\n    if n < 5:\n        print(-1)\n        continue\n    for i in range(2,n+1,2):\n        if i != 4:\n            print(i,end=\" \")\n    print(\"4 5\",end=\" \")\n    for i in range(1,n+1,2):\n        if i != 5:\n            print(i, end = \" \")\n    print()"
