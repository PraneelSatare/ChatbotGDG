1136B - Nastya Is Playing Computer GamesNote that in any case we will open n hatches. Also, initial position of stones is : 1,1,1,1,1,1...1 (1 - the number of stones on the i-th hatch ).After any permutation of stones we will have permutation of numbers : 2,0,1,1,1,1,1... So, to open hatch with 2 stones, we need at least 2 movements. So, at all, we need at least n+1 movements(1). To get into all the hatches we need at least min(n−k,k−1)+n−1 movements.(since we can only go to the neighboring). So, at all, answer is : (n+1)+n+(n−1)+min(n−k,k−1)=3n+min(n−k,k−1).Code(Idea of the problem C — usertab34)
