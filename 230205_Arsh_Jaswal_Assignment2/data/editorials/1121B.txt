1121B - Mike and ChildrenNotice that the sum of sweets each child gets cannot exceed 2â‹…105, so for each of numbers no more than this threshold we can store the number of ways to obtain it as the sum of two sweets. It can be done just by considering all possible (unordered) pairs of sweets and printing the maximal obtained number (of ways to represent something as sum of two sweets). Indeed, if x can be represented as a sum of two sweets in several ways then no two of them share a sweet since if ai+aj = ai+ak then aj=ak and therefore j=k. Problem B of final/C div2 (System Testing)
