1679B - Stone Age ProblemAs we want to perform queries fast, we will store some variables: current sum of all elements in the array sum, index of the last query of the second type lastSecondQuery and its value lastSecondQueryValue. For each element of the array we will also store index of the last query of the first type that changed this element lastFirstQuery[i] and its value lastFirstQueryValue[i].Now let's answer the queries. If we are going to perform a query of the first type, we have to know, what the number ai equals now. If lastSecondQuery>lastFirstQuery[i], then ai=lastSecondQueryValue now, and ai=lastFirstQueryValue[i] otherwise. Now let's subtract ai from the sum, change lastFirstQuery[i] and lastFirstQueryValue[i], and add the new value ai to the sum.If we are going to perform a query of the second type, we have to update values lastSecondQuery and lastSecondQueryValue. The new sum of all elements of the array is nâ‹…lastSecondQueryValue.Time complexity: O(n+q).
