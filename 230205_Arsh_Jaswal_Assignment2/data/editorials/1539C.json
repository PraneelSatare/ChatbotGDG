    "solution": "1539C - Stable GroupsFirstly, we will find the amount of groups needed if we don't add any new students. Let's consider the students in the increasing order of their knowledge level. Students are greedily determined to the same group if the difference of their knowledge levels is not greater than x. Else we create another group. After that all students will be split into continuous non-intersecting segments  — stable groups.Merging two segments with knowledge difference d may be done by adding ⌈dx⌉−1 new students. Each such merge decreases the answer by 1 so we should maximize the amount of merges. To do that we should just consider the merges in increasing order of their costs. "
