1013B - AndClearly, if it is possible then there are no more than 2 operations needed.So we basically need to distinguish 4 outcomes —  - 1, 0, 1 and 2.The answer is zero if there are already equal elements in the array.To check if the answer is -1 we can apply the operation to each element of the array. If all elements are still distinct, then it couldn't be helped.To check if the answer is one we can bruteforce the element a to apply the operation to, and if this operation changes this element, we can check if there is an a & x element in the array.In all other cases answer is two.D1A author: isaf27, developer: isaf27
