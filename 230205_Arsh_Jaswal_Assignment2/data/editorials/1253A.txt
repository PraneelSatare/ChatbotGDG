1253A - Single PushIf we set di=bi−ai, we have to check that d has the following form: [0,0,…,0,k,k,…,k,0,0,…,0]. Firstly check that there is no negative element in d.Solution 1 : add 0 to the beginning and the end of the array d, then check that there is at most two indices i such that di≠di+1.Solution 2 : let l be the smallest integer such that dl≠0, and r be the greatest integer such that dr≠0. Check that for all l≤i≤r, di=dl.Complexity : O(n) for each test case.Implementation (solution 1)
