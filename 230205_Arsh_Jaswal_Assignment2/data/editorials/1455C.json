    "solution": "1455C - Ping-pongLet's find an answer for a little different version of the game. Let's say that f(x,y) is the final score if the first player has x stamina and the second has y stamina. The first player can either hit the ball or can give up and lose the play.How to calculate f(x,y)? Obviously, f(0,x)=(0,x) and f(x,0)=(x,0). Otherwise, the first player can   either hit the ball: then the player spent 1 stamina and now it's to the second player to decide — hit or lose. So basically, we moved to the state f(y,x−1) and the answer in this case is rev(f(y,x−1)) where rev(a,b)=(b,a);  or lose the play: then the player doesn't spend any stamina, but the opponent has to serve the ball. He serves the ball, spend 1 stamina and return to the state, where the first player decides — hit or lose. Formally, the answer in this case is f(x,y−1)+(0,1). Looking at f(0,x)=(0,x), f(x,0)=(x,0) and one of transitions f(x,y−1)+(0,1) we can guess that f(x,y)=(x,y) and prove it by induction: f(x,y) is either rev(f(y,x−1)) or f(x,y−1)+(0,1), but rev(f(y,x−1))=rev(y,x−1)=(x−1,y) and f(x,y−1)+(0,1)=(x,y−1)+(0,1)=(x,y) and (x,y) is better than (x−1,y), so f(x,y)=(x,y).The final step is to note that since Alice starts the first play and has to serve ball — the answer is rev(f(y,x−1))=rev(y,x−1)=(x−1,y).
