    "solution": "1020B - BadgeIn this problem you are given a graph, with one outgoing edge from each vertex. You are asked which vertex is first to be visited twice, if you start in some vertex, and go by outgoing edge from current vertex until you visited some vertex twice.The problem can be solved by straightforward implementation. You choose a starting vertex (which student is first to get a hole in their badge), and keep the current vertex, and for all vertices how many times it was visited. After transition to the next vertex you just check if it has been already visited, and update visited mark for it.This solution works in O(n2), and is very easy in implementation. It can be optimized to O(n), but it was not necessary in this problem. It an easy and useful exercise left to reader. "
