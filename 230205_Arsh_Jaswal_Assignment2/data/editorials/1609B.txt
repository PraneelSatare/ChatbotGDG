1609B - William the VigilantNotice that the answer to this problem is the number of substrings "abc"Before starting to process queries let's count the number of substrings "abc" in the initial string. Next, notice that changing a character on position pos can only remove one substring "abc" and add only one substring "abc". To check if either of those changes occurred we only need to look at characters no more than two positions away from pos and see if substring "abc" appeared (or disappeared) there.Prepared by AleXman111.Solution: 137274647
