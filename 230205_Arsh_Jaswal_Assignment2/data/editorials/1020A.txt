1020A - New Building for SISIn this problem you need to find a shortest path between some locations in a building. You need to look at some cases to solve this problem. First, if locations are in the same tower (ta = tb), you don't need to use a passages between two towers at all, and answer is fa - fb. In other case, you have to use some passage between towers. Obviously, you need to use only passage on one floor. The easiest way to do this is to write down interesting floors in array — the floor where you start, the floor where you end your path, first and last floors with passages. After that you can choose interesting floor x where you will use a passage, check if there is a passage at this floor (a ≤ x ≤ b), and update answer with an expression like |ta - tb| + |fa - x| + |fb - x|.Another method is to choose a floor where you use a passage by case handling. If you start on the floor fa, and there is a passage, you can just use this passage. Otherwise, you choose between floors a and b, whichever is closer to the start.
