1174B - Ehab Is an Odd PersonNotice that you can only swap 2 elements if they have different parities. If all elements in the array have the same parity, you can't do any swaps, and the answer will just be like the input. Otherwise, let's prove you can actually swap any pair of elements. Assume you want to swap 2 elements, a and b, and they have the same parity. There must be a third element c that has a different parity. Without loss of generality, assume the array is [a,b,c]. You'll do the following swaps:  Swap a and c: [c,b,a]. Swap b and c: [b,c,a]. Swap a and c: [b,a,c]. In other words, you'll use c as an intermediate element to swap a and b, and it'll return to its original position afterwards! Since you can swap any pair of elements, you can always sort the array, which is the lexicographically smallest permutation.Code link: https://pastebin.com/xhqGXLiuTime complexity: O(nlog(n)).
