    "solution": "1131C - День рожденияThe solution is greedy one.Suppose we have reordered ai, so that ai≤ai+1.Then I claim that the answer can be built as follows:First write all elements with even indices and then all elements with odd indices in reversed order.For example, if n=5: we get a1,a3,a5∣a4,a2 and if n=6: a1,a3,a5∣a6,a4,a2.One can \"check on many tests\" that it works in practice, but here goes the proof:Note, that the solution provides answer which is at most maxai+2−ai.Let's show that for every i, answer must be at least ai+2−ai. To do this, draw all ai's as a graph. Then the solution to the problem is some Hamiltonian cycle.Let's suppose that ai+2−ai is prohibited to us (and all jumps containing this one).  Red denotes the forbidden jumps. One can easily see, that ai+1 is a cut point, and no hamiltonian cycle is possible. This concludes our proof!(Developing — cdkrot, idea — jury) "
