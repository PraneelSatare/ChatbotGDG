    "solution": "987B - High School: Become HumanWe need to compare xy with yx. Let's take logarithms of both sides. Now we need to compare ylnx with xlny. If you will compare this numbers with appropriate epsilon, it will get AC, but let's analyze a bit more and get solution in integers. Let's divide both sides by xy, now we need to compare lnxx with lnyy. That's the values of some function f(x)=lnxx taken in two points. Let's take a closer look on this function. You can take derivative or just look at the plot at WolframAlpha.It's clear that this function have maximum at point e, and it is increasing on [1,e] and decreasing on [e,+∞). Considering only integer points, f(1)=0, f(3) is maximal, f(2)=f(4) (because 24=42=16), and values in points greater than 4 are decreasing but always positive. So, the order of x from larger f(x) to smaller f(x) is 3,2=4,5,6,…,+∞,1.38799800 — logs38799811 — case analisys "
