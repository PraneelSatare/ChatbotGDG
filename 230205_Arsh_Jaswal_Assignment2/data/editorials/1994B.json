    "solution": "1994B - Fun GameIf the string s consists entirely of 0, then obviously no other string can be obtained from it, so the answer is \"Yes\" only if s=t.Otherwise, let i — the index of the first 1 in s. Note that if there is at least one 1 in t at positions [1;i), then the answer is \"No\", since s has 0 at these positions, so some of them must be changed to 1. However, when applying the operation the first 1 from position i can change bits only at positions greater than or equal to i, i.e. it will not be possible to change 0 at positions before i.If there is only 0 at positions [1;i) in t, then it is possible to change any bit on the segment [i;n] in s to any other bit by choosing segments of length i and acting from the end, i.e. the answer is \"Yes\".
