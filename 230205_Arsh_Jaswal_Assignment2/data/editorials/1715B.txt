1715B - Beautiful ArrayTo start with, the sum of the numbers in the array s cannot be less, than k⋅b (where k is the number by which we divide, and b is beauty (s≥k⋅b))It is important, that s≤k⋅b+(k−1)⋅n. Let's assume that is not true. Consider the sum of divisible parts of numbers in the array: it obviously does not exceed k⋅b, thus the sum of remainders is at least (k−1)⋅n+1, which means, that at least one of the numbers' remainders is k, which is impossible by definition of the remainder.That way we got the criteria for the existence of the answer: k⋅b≤s≤k⋅b+(k−1)⋅n.If there does exist an answer, then we can use the following algorithm:  Assign k⋅b to any of the n cells of the array.  Iterate over all the cells (including the cell from the previous item) and add min(s−sum,k−1) to the current cell, where sum is the current sum of the elements.
