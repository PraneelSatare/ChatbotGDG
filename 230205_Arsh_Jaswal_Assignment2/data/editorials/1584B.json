    "solution": "1584B - Coloring RectanglesRectangles after cutting will be painted in a chess coloring. So, if the area is even, then the number of cells of different colors is the same, and if it is odd, then it differs by exactly 1.Let's find out what part the colored cells occupy in relation to all of them. For an even area, this ratio is always 12. For odd S−12⋅S. The smaller the odd area, the smaller the ratio. An area equal to 1 cannot be obtained, so the best ratio is 13 and is achieved with an area equal to 3.Then we get the lower estimate for the answer: answer≥n⋅m⋅13. Great!We know that the answer is integer, so if we manage to construct such a cut that it is necessary to color exactly such a cnt of cells thatn⋅m3≤cnt<n⋅m3+1, then cnt will be the answer. After all, cnt is the minimum integer value satisfying the estimate.If one of the sides is divisible by 3, then it is obvious how to cut into 1×3 rectangles and get the perfect answer.If the remains of sides 1 and 1 or 2 and 2, then you can cut into 1×3 rectangles and one rectangle with an area of 4, in which you need to paint over 2 cells. Then the answer also fits the assessment.If the remains of sides 1 and 2, then after cutting into 1×3 rectangles, a rectangle will remain 1×2, in which you need to paint one cell. The answer also fits the assessment.For all pairs of remains, there is a way to construct an answer satisfying the inequality. Therefore, the answer is ⌈n⋅m3⌉ "
