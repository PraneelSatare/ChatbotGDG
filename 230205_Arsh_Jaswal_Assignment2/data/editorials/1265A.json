    "solution": "1265A - Beautiful StringIf string s initially contains 2 equal consecutive letters (\"aa\", \"bb\" or \"cc\") then the answer is obviously -1. Otherwise, it is always possible to replacing all characters '?' to make s beautiful. We will replacing one '?' at a time and in any order (from left to right for example). For each '?', since it is adjacent to at most 2 other characters and we have 3 options ('a', 'b' and 'c') for this '?', there always exists at least one option which differ from 2 characters that are adjacent with this '?'. Simply find one and replace '?' by it.Time comlexity: O(n) where n is length of s.
