    "solution": "1672C - Unequal ArrayAuthor: maomao90 HintsHint 1If the array is a=[1,1,…,1]. We will need 0 moves if n≤2 and will need max(n−3,1) moves. Hint 2The only way to reduce the number of i such that ai=ai+1 is when ai=ai+1 and ai+2=ai+3, and you apply the operation on ai+1 and ai+2. TutorialSuppose l is the smallest index where al=al+1 and r is the largest index where ar=ar+1. If l=r or l and r does not exist, the condition is already satisfied and we can do 0 operations. Otherwise, the answer is max(1,r−l−1). The proof is as follows:  Suppose l+1=r, then, there are 3 elements that are adjacent to each other. Hence, we can just do one operation with i=l and x=∞ to make the equality of the array 1. Suppose otherwise, then the array will look something like [...,X,X,...,Y,Y,...], with r−l−2 elements between the second X and the first Y. Then, we can do operations on i=l+1,l+2,…,r−2,r−1 to make the equality of the array 1. To see why we need at least r−l−1 operations, observe that each operation will cause r−l to decrease by at most 1. This is because if we do not do an operation on i∈{l−1,l+1,r−1,r+1}, then both al=al+1 and ar=ar+1 will still hold. We see that r−l only decreases when do we an operation on i∈l+1,r−1 and it is not too hard to show that it only decreases by 1 in those cases while r−l>2Hence, we keep doing the operation until r−l=2, which will only require 1 operation to change both pairs and make the equality 1.
