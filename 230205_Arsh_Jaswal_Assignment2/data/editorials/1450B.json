    "solution": "1450B - Balls of SteelWe claim the answer is always −1 or 1.In fact, suppose in the first operation of a solution we select a point p. If we aren't done, there will at least one point with distance more than k from p. However, there will be no point within distance k of p, no matter how we perform future operations. So it is impossible for p to merge with a new point, and a solution with more than 1 operation will be impossible.To see if the answer is 1, we should check if there is some point p within distance k from all other points. Otherwise, the answer is −1. Complexity is O(n2) to compute pairwise distances.Implementation"
