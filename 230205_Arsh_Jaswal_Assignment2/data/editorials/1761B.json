    "solution": "1761B - Elimination of a RingHintDo we need more than 3 types of elements? Try to solve the problem with aiâ‰¤3.SolutionFirst of all, when there're only 2 types of elements appearing in the sequence, the answer would be n2+1.Otherwise, the conclusion is that we can always reach n operations when there are more than 2 types of elements appearing in the sequence.The proof is given below: When the length of the sequence is greater than 3, there will always be a pair of positions (i,j), such that ai=aj and ai has two different neighboring elements. Then we can erase ai and then the problem is decomposed into a smaller one. If there do not exist such pairs, then we can infer that there exists at least 1 element which appeared only once in the sequence. If there exists such element b, then we can continuously erase all the elements next to b, then erase b at last. When the length n of the sequence is less than 3, it is clear that there will be exactly n operations as well.So we only need to check the number of elements that appeared in the sequence of length n. If the number is 2, the answer will be n2+1. Otherwise, the answer equals n. Author: Jelefy "
