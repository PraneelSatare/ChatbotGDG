888B - Buggy RobotConsider the final cell after original path. It has some distance dx to x = 0 and dy to y = 0. That means the path included at least dx and dy in corresponding directions. Let's remove just these minimal numbers of moves.Finally, the answer will be n - dx - dy, where (dx, dy) are distances from the final cell of the original path to (0, 0).Overall complexity: O(n).
