    "solution": "1730C - Minimum NotationWe leave all suffix minimums by the digits mni (digits less than or equal to the minimum among the digits to the right of them), remove the rest and replace them with min(d+1,9) (using the described operations) and add to lexicographically minimum order on the right (due to the appropriate order of operations, this is possible). The suffix minimums mni should be left, because no matter what digit we leave after mni, it will be no less than mni, and therefore will not improve the answer. The rest must be removed at the end with operations, since there is a number to the right less than this one, i.e. if you remove everything before it (put mni at the current position), the answer will become less than if you leave another digit at this position.Jury solution: 173498569 "
