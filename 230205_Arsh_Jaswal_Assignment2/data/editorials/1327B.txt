1327B - Princesses and PrincesSimulate the process without adding the new entry. For this you can just maintain an array taken, i-th value of which is true if the i-th prince is married and false otherwise.Now observe that there are two possible outcomes:   Every daughter is married â€” the answer is optimal.  There is a daughter who isn't married. That means that there is a free prince as well. Marry them to each other because doing that won't affect any other marriages and add a new one to the answer. Overall complexity: O(n+m). Solution (pikmike)from sys import stdin, stdout
