1726B - Mainak and Interesting SequenceLemma: In an interesting sequence a1,a2,…,an, every element other than the largest must have even occurrences.Proof: For the sake of contradiction, assume that for some x (x>0), such than x≠maxi=1n{ai}, x appears an odd number of times. Let P(z) denote the bitwise XOR of all elements in a that are less than z. By assumption P(x)=0. Now, since x is not maximum of the sequence a, there exists y in a, such that x<y and there are no other elements t such that x<t<y (in other words, y is the immediate larger element of x in a). Again, P(y)=0 as well by assumption. However, since x appears an odd number of times, we have: 0=P(y)=P(x)⊕x=0⊕x=x, which is a contradiction as x must be positive.This gives us an O(n) solution as follows: Case - I: If n>m — It is clearly impossible to construct an interesting sequence with sum equal to m (as integers must be positive). Case - II: n is odd — Create (n−1) occurrences of 1, and a single occurrence of (m−n+1). Case - III: n is even, m is even — Create (n−2) occurrences of 1 and two occurrences of (m−n+2)/2. Case - IV: n is even, m is odd — No such interesting sequences exist.  Proof: For the sake of contradiction assume that such an interesting sequence, a, exists. Since m is odd, there must be an odd number x that occurs an odd number of times in a. Again since n is even there must be another integer y (different from x) that occurs an also odd number of times. Hence either x or y (whichever is lower) violates the lemma.
