1598C - Delete Two ElementsFirst of all, instead of the mathematic mean, let's consider the sum of elements. If the mathematic mean is k, then the sum of elements of the array is k⋅n. Let's denote the sum of elements in the original array as s. Note s is always an integer.If we remove two elements from the array, the resulting sum of elements should become k⋅(n−2)=s⋅(n−2)n. So, the sum of the elements we remove should be exactly 2sn.If 2sn is not an integer, the answer is 0 (to check that, you can simply compare (2s)modn with 0). Otherwise, we have to find the number of pairs (i,j) such that i<j and ai+aj=2sn. This is a well-known problem.To solve it, you can calculate the number of occurrences of each element and store it in some associative data structure (for example, map in C++). Let cntx be the number of occurrences of element x. Then, you should iterate on the element ai you want to remove and check how many elements match it, that is, how many elements give exactly 2sn if you add ai to them. The number of these elements is just cnt2sn−ai. Let's sum up all these values for every element in the array.Unfortunately, this sum is not the answer yet. We need to take care of two things:  if for some index i, 2⋅ai=2sn, then ai matches itself, so you have to subtract the number of such elements from the answer;  every pair of elements is counted twice: the first time when we consider the first element of the pair, and the second time — when we consider the second element of the pair. So, don't forget to divide the answer by 2.  Solution (Neon)#include <bits/stdc++.h>

    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    vector<int> a(n);
    map<int, int> cnt;
    for (auto &x : a) {
      scanf("%d", &x);
      cnt[x] += 1;
    }
    long long sum = accumulate(a.begin(), a.end(), 0LL);
    if ((2 * sum) % n != 0) {
      puts("0");
      continue;
    }
    long long need = (2 * sum) / n;
    long long ans = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      int a1 = a[i];
      int a2 = need - a1;
      if (cnt.count(a2)) ans += cnt[a2];
      if (a1 == a2) ans -= 1;
    }
    printf("%lld\n", ans / 2);
