1033A - King EscapeImagine a two-dimensional plane with origin positioned on the black queen. We notice that the queen partitions the board into up to four connected components, with each quadrant being one of them. The answer is thus "YES" if and only if the source king position and the target position are in the same quadrant. This condition can be checked in O(1) using few simple ifs.In case you prefer brute force over case analysis, it is also possible to construct the grid graph and find the connected components or use DFS to find the path. This runs in O(n2).
