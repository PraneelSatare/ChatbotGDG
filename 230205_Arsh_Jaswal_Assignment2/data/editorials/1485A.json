    "solution": "1485A - Add and DivideAuthor: TheScrasse Preparation: MyK_00L Hint 1Suppose that you can use x operations of type 1 and y operations of type 2. Try to reorder the operations in such a way that a becomes the minimum possible. Hint 2You should use operations of type 2 first, then moves of type 1. How many operations do you need in the worst case? (a=109, b=1) Hint 3You need at most 30 operations. Iterate over the number of operations of type 2. SolutionNotice how it is never better to increase b after dividing (⌊ab+1⌋≤⌊ab⌋).So we can try to increase b to a certain value and then divide a by b until it is 0. Being careful as not to do this with b<2, the number of times we divide is going to be O(loga). In particular, if you reach b≥2 (this requires at most 1 move), you need at most ⌊log2(109)⌋=29 moves to finish.Let y be the number of moves of type 2; we can try all values of y (0≤y≤30) and, for each y, check how many moves of type 1 are necessary.Complexity: O(log2a).If we notice that it is never convenient to increase b over 6, we can also achieve a solution with better complexity.Official solution: 107232596"
