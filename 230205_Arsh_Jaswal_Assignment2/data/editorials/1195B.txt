This equation can be solved mathematically. The only problem is getting the square root, it can be avoided with binary search or taking square root in non-integer numbers and checking some amount of integers in small range nearby the obtained root. The other solution is the binary search by x.  Solution (binary search)#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
    long long n, k;
    std::cin >> n >> k;
    long long l = -1, r = n + 1;
    while (r - l > 1) {
        long long m = (l + r) / 2;
        if ((n - m) * (n - m + 1) / 2 - m > k)
            l = m;
        else
            r = m;
    }
    std::cout << r;
    return 0;
} Solution (formula)#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

int main() {
    long long n, k;
    std::cin >> n >> k;
    std::cout << static_cast<long long>(round(n + 1.5 - sqrt(2 * (n + k) + 2.75)));
    return 0;
