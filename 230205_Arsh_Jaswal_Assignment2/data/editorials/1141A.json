    "solution": "1141A - Game 23If m is not divisible by n then just print -1 and stop the program. Otherwise, calculate d=m/n, denoting the required number of times to multiply n. It is easy to see that d should be a product of zero or more 2's and of zero or more 3's, i.e. d=2x3y for integers x,y≥0. To find x just use a loop to divide d by 2 while it is divisible by 2. Similarly, to find y just use a loop to divide d by 3 while it is divisible by 3. After the divisions, the expected value of d is 1. If d≠1, print -1. Otherwise, print the total number of the loop iterations.
