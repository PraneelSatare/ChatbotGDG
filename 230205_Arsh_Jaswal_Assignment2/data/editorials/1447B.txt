1447B - Numbers Box HintWe want to minimize the number of negative numbers as much as we can by applying the operations. What is the minimum possible number of those negatives? SolutionLet X be the number of non-zero numbers in the grid, and let's see what happens in different scenarios.  both cells have negative numbers, then X goes down by 2. both cells have positive numbers, then X goes up by 2. one cell has a positive number while the other one has a negative number, then X stays the same. It is important to notice that we can apply this operation not only for the two neighboring cells, but for any two — to achieve this effect we apply this operation on any path between the cells consecutively.The parity of X never changes. So, for even X the answer is the sum of the absolute value of all numbers, S. Otherwise, one element will not be positive in the end -- so it's best to choose the one with minimum absolute value, V, and subtract 2⋅V from the sum.The existence of zeroes doesn't really change anything, both formulas output the same value in such a case.This gives us a solution in O(N⋅M)
