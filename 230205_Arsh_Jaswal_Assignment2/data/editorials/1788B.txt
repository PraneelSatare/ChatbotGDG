1788B - Sum of Two NumbersLet's assume that there is no carry while adding x and y. Denote n=a9⋯a1a0, x=b9⋯b1b0, y=c9⋯c1c0 in decimal system. The condition can be changed as the following condition.- ai=bi+ci for all 0≤i≤9. - Sum of bi and sum of ci should differ by at most 1.If ai is even, let bi=ci=ai/2. Otherwise, let bi and ci be ai+12 or ai−12. By alternating between (bi,ci)=(ai+12,ai−12) and (bi,ci)=(ai−12,ai+12), we can satisfy the condition where sum of bi and sum of ci differ by at most 1.There is an alternative solution. If n is even, divide it into (n2,n2). If remainder of n divided by 10 is not 9, divide it into (n+12,n−12). If remainder of n divided by 10 is 9, recursively find an answer for ⌊n10⌋ which is (x′,y′) and the answer will be (10x′+4,10y′+5) or (10x′+5,10y′+4) depending on what number has a bigger sum of digits.The following solution has a countertest.1. Trying to find x and y by bruteforce from (1,n−1). 2. Trying to find x and y by bruteforce from (n+12,n−12)A solution that randomly finds (x,y) passes.
