1760E - Binary InversionsLet's find out how to count the number of binary inversions, without flips. This is the number of 1s that appear before a 0. To do this, iterate through the array and keep a running total k of the number of 1s seen so far. When we see a 0, increase the total inversion count by k, since this 0 makes k inversions: one for each of the 1s before it.Now let's see how to maximize the inversions. Consider the flip 0â†’1. We claim that it is best to always flip the earliest 0 in the array. It's never optimal to flip a later 0, since we have strictly fewer 0s after it to form inversions. Similarly, we should flip the latest 1 in the array.Now recalculate the answer for these two choices for flipping, and pick the maximum. The complexity is O(n). Solution#include "bits/stdc++.h"
