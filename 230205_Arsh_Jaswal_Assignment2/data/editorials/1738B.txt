1738B - Prefix Sum AddictsIf k=1, it is always possible, so the answer is "YES".In the following, we assume that k≥2. Here, we are given sn−k+1,…,sn. We can resume an−k+2,…,an by letting ai=si−si−1 for every n−k+2≤i≤n.If the known elements of ai cannot form a sorted array, i.e., it does not hold that an−k+2≤⋯≤an, the answer is "NO".Note that the sum of the first n−k+1 elements of ai should satisfy that sn−k+1=a1+⋯+an−k+1≤(n−k+1)an−k+2. If this does not hold, the answer is "NO".Having checked that both an−k+2≤⋯≤an and sn−k+1≤(n−k+1)an−k+2 hold, we claim that the answer is "YES".
