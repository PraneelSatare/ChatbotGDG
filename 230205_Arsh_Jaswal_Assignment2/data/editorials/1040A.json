    "solution": "1040A - Palindrome DanceConsider a pair of dancers located symmetrically with respect to the center of the stage. If they already have different suits, the answer is definitely \"impossible\". If they both have same suits, they are fine. If one of them doesn't have a suit, buy him a matching one. Finally, if both don't have suits, buy them two same suits of the cheaper color. Also, if n is odd and the central dancer doesn't have a suit, buy him a cheaper one. "
