1345B - Card ConstructionsLet's count the number of cards in a pyramid of height h. There are 2(1+2+3+⋯+h) cards standing up, and there are 0+1+2+⋯+(h−1) horizontal cards. So, there are 2h(h+1)2+(h−1)h2=32h2+12h cards total. Using this formula, we can quickly find the largest height h that uses at most n cards.The quadratic formula or binary search can be used here, but are unnecessary. Simply iterating through all h values works in O(n−−√) time per test.It's enough to see that this takes O(tN−−√) time overall, where N is the sum of n across all test cases. But interestingly, we can argue for a tighter bound of O(tN−−−√) due to the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality:∑i=1t(1⋅ni−−√)≤(∑i=1t12)(∑i=1t(n−−√i)2)−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−⎷=tN−−−√
