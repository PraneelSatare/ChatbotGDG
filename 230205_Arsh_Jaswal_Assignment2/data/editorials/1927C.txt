1927C - Choose the Different Ones!Notice that elements with a value greater than k are not relevant to us. Let's divide the values into three categories:  Occurring only in array a;  occurring only in array b;  occurring in both arrays. The answer will be NO if any of the following conditions are met:  the number of values of the first type is greater than k2 (this implies that we cannot select all such elements);  the number of values of the second type is greater than k2 (this implies that we cannot select all such elements);  the total number of values of all three types is less than k (this implies that some values do not occur in either of the arrays). Otherwise, the answer is YES. Solutiondef solve():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    cnt = [0] * (k + 1)
    for e in a:
        if e <= k:
            cnt[e] |= 1
    for e in b:
        if e <= k:
            cnt[e] |= 2
    c = [0] * 4
    for e in cnt:
        c[e] += 1
    if c[1] > k // 2 or c[2] > k // 2 or c[1] + c[2] + c[3] != k:
        print("NO")
    else:
        print("YES")
