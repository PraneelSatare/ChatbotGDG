1023B - Pair of ToysThe problem is to calculate the number of ways to choose two distinct integers from 1 to n with sum equals k.If k≤n then the answer is ⌊k2⌋ because this is the number of ways to choose two distinct integers from 1 to k−1 with the sum equals k. Otherwise let mn=n−k will be the minimum possible term in the correct pair of integers. Also let mx=n will be the maximum possible term in the correct pair of integers. Then the answer is max(0,⌊mx−mn+12⌋) because this is the number of ways to choose two distinct integers from mn to mx with the sum equals k.Problem idea: MikeMirzayanov, prepared by: MikeMirzayanov.
