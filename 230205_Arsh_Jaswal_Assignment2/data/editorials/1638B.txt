1638B - Odd Swap Sort Hint 1Replace the condition "ai+ai+1 is odd" with something easier to work with. Hint 2The condition means that we only swap elements of different parity. Now, make some observations. Hint 3What happens if there are some elements ai and aj (i<j) of the same parity, such that ai>aj? Hint 4If such pair exists, the answer is "NO". Now consider the array to be a merge between two increasing arrays (one with odd elements, one with even elements). Try to prove that the answer is always "YES" in this case. Hint 5What does the Bubble Sort algorithm do here? Does it ever do an illegal swap? TutorialThe condition "ai+ai+1 is odd" means that we can only swap elements of different parity. If either the order of even elements or the order of odd elements is not non-decreasing, then it is impossible to sort the sequence. Otherwise, let's prove that it is always possible to sort the sequence. We can for example perform Bubble Sort algorithm. Note that this algorithm only swaps elements ai and ai+1 if ai>ai+1, so it will never swap two elements of the same parity (given our assumption on their order).Time complexity: O(n).
