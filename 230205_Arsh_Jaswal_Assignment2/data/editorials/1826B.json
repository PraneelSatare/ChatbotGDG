    "solution": "1826B - Lunatic Never ContentFor the sequence to be a palindrome, it has to satisfy bi=bn−i+1. In our case bi=ai(modx). We can rewrite the palindrome equation as ai(modx)=an−i+1(modx). Moving all the terms to the left we get ai−an−i+1≡0(modx), which basically says x divides ai−an−i+1.Now, how to find the biggest x, which satisfies all such conditions? Greatest common divisor of course! We just need to calculate the GCD of the numbers ai−an−i+1 for all i.This results in a O(n+log(109)) solution, since computing the gcd of n numbers up to 109 takes exactly this much time.A useful assumption here is that GCD(x,0)=x for any number x. This holds true for standard template library implementations. And do not forget that this function should work correctly for negative numbers too. An easy trick here is to just use the absolute value of ai−an−i+1.С++ Implementation: 204718497"
