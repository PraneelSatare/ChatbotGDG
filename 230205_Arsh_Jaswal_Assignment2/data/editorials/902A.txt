902A - Visiting a FriendNote that if we can get to some point x, then we can get to all points <= x. So we can support the rightmost point where we can get to. Then if this point can use the teleport (if this point is to the right of the teleport), we'll try to move it (If the limit of the teleport is to the right of the current point, then move it there). Then in the end we need to check that the rightmost point where we can get is equal to M.
