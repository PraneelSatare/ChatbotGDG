    "solution": "1332A - Exercising WalkThe key observation is x-axis and y-axis is independent in this task as the area is a rectangle. Therefore, we should only consider 1D case (x-axis, for example). The optimal path to choose alternates between right and left moves until only one type of move is possible. And sometimes there is no place to make even one move, which has to handled separately. So the verdict is \"Yes\" if and only if x1≤x−a+b≤x2 and (x1<x2 or a+b=0).
