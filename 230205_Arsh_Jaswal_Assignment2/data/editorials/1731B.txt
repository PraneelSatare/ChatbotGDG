1731B - Уничтожение демодоговTo kill the maximum number of demodogs, El can travel in zigzag fashion, i.e. from (1,1) to (1,2) to (2,2) and so on. Thus the answer would be the sum of elements at (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) … (n,n). i.e. the answer is ∑i=1ni⋅i+∑i=1n−1i(i+1)=n(n+1)(4n−1)6.And the answer you need to print is 2022n(n+1)(4n−1)6=337⋅n(n+1)(4n−1)(mod109+7)Proof:Let killsi,j be the maximum number of kills of all possible paths from (1,1) to (i,j).killsn−1,n−1≥killsi,n−1 + number of demodogs from (i+1,n−1) to (n−1,n−1) (∀i∈[1,n−2]).killsn−1,n−1≥killsi,n−1+∑j=i+1n−1j⋅(n−1)killsn−1,n−1≥killsi,n−1+(n−1−i)((i+1)(n−1)+(n−2−i)(n−1))2 (sum of A.P.)killsn−1,n−1≥killsi,n−1+(n−1−i)(n−1)22 (1)Let killsZ be the number of kills if El travels in zigzag fashion, i.e. she goes to (n,n) after passing through (n−1,n−1): killsZn,n=killsn−1,n−1+n(n−1)+n⋅nLet killsNZ be the maximum number of kills If El goes to (n,n) after passing through (i,n) for some i in range of [1…n−1], i.e. El goes from (1,1) to (i,n−1) to (i,n) to (n,n): killsNZn,n=killsi,n−1+no of demigods from (i,n) to (n,n)killsNZn,n=killsi,n−1+∑j=inj⋅nkillsNZn,n=killsi,n−1+(n+1−i)(n+i)n2killsZn,n−killsNZn,n=killsn−1,n−1+n(n−1)+n⋅n−killsi,n−1−(n+1−i)(n+i)n2 from (1)killsZn,n−killsNZn,n≥killsi,n−1+(n−1−i)(n−1)22+n(n−1)+n⋅n−killsi,n−1−(n+1−i)(n+i)n2killsZn,n−killsNZn,n≥2n2−3n−n⋅i−i−12killsZn,n−killsNZn,n≥0 since 2n2−3n−n⋅i−i−1≥0 for all i∈[1,n−2].In other words, killsZn,n≥killsNZn,n Therefore zigzag path guarantees maximum number of demodog kills.Now, the last thing was taking the modulus. Modulus should always be taken after every multiply operation to avoid the overflow. You can refer to modular arithmetic for more details.And the main reason we told you to multiply the answer by 2022 is that we needed to divide it by 6. For division, we have to take inverse modulo in modular arithmetic. So, in order to avoid that, we gave you a multiple of 6, which is 2022. Code186975620
