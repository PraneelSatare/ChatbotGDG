1567B - MEXor MixupFirst consider the MEX condition: the shortest array with MEX a is the array [0,1,…,a−1], which has length a. Now we'll consider the XOR condition. Let the XOR of the array [0,1,…,a−1] be x. We have three cases.Case 1: x=b. Then we don't need to add any elements to the array, so the answer is a.Case 2: x≠b and x⊕b≠a. Then we can add the element x⊕b to the array since x⊕b≠a, so the MEX will still be a. The XOR of the array will then be x⊕x⊕b=b. The answer is a+1.Case 3: x≠b and x⊕b=a. Then we cannot add the element x⊕b to the end of the array. We can just add x⊕b⊕1 and 1, so the XOR of the array will be x⊕x⊕b⊕1⊕1=b. The answer is a+2.Time complexity: O(n) precomputation and O(1) per test case if you precalculate the XOR of the numbers from 0 to n−1, or O(1) if you use the well-known formula for it.
