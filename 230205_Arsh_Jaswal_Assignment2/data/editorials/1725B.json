    "solution": "1725B - Basketball TogetherFor a team of c players with a biggest power of b, the total power of the team is b×c. So for a team with a biggest power of b to win, it needs to have at least ⌈D+1b⌉ players.For each player i, we can calculate a value f(i) which means a team that has player i as its biggest power needs to have at least f(i) players to win. We can see that the bigger the value of Pi, the smaller the value of f(i).We can also see that if a formed team is said to have a fixed biggest power and a fixed number of players, the powers of the players that are less than the biggest power do not affect the total power of the team. So those players can be anyone.Using the information above, we can form the teams using a greedy method. We iterate through each candidate player starting from the biggest Pi and form new teams with each next biggest candidate player power as each team's biggest power. We do that while maintaining the total number of extra players required to make all formed teams win. We stop once the number of remaining players is not enough for the total number of extra players required.Time complexity: O(NlogN)"
