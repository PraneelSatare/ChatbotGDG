1909B - Make Almost Equal With ModAuthor: TheScrasse Preparation: TheScrasse Hint 1Find a value of k that works in many cases. Hint 2k=2 works in many cases. What if it does not work? Hint 3If k=2 does not work, either all the numbers are even or all the numbers are odd. Which k can you try now? SolutionLet f(k) be the number of distinct values after the operation, using k.Let's try k=2. It works in all cases, except when either all the numbers are even or all the numbers are odd.Let's generalize. If ai mod k=x, one of the following holds:  ai mod 2k=x; ai mod 2k=x+k; It means that, if f(k)=1 (i.e., all the values after the operations are x), either f(2k)=1 (if either all the values become x, or they all become x+k), or f(2k)=2.Therefore, it is sufficient to try k=21,…,257. In fact, f(1)=1 and f(257)=n, so there must exist m<57 such that f(2m)=1 and f(2m+1)≠1⟹f(2m+1)=2.Alternative (more intuitive?) interpretation:  ai mod 2j corresponds to the last j digits in the binary representation of ai. There must exist j such that the last j digits make exactly 2 distinct blocks. In the following picture, a=[1005,2005,7005,11005,16005] and k=16: PictureComplexity: O(nlog(maxai))
