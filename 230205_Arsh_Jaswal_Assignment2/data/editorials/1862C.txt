1862C - Flower City FenceObviously, if a1≠n, then this fence is not symmetric, because the fence a has a length of n, while the horizontally laid fence has a length of a1≠n.Now let's build a fence b using horizontal boards that would match the original fence a. And let's check if the arrays a and b are equal. If they are equal, then the fence is symmetric; otherwise, it is not. There won't be any memory issues since all ai≤n, which means the length of array b does not exceed n. Solution#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
 
using namespace std;
 
int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        vector<int> a(n + 1);
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            cin >> a[i];
        }
        if (a[1] != n) {
            cout << "NO" << '\n';
            continue;
        }
        vector<int> b;
        for (int i = n; i >= 1; i--) {
            while (b.size() < a[i]) {
                b.push_back(i);
            }
        }
        bool meow = true;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (a[i] != b[i - 1]) {
                cout << "NO" << '\n';
                meow = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (meow) {
            cout << "YES" << '\n';
        }
    }
    return 0;
