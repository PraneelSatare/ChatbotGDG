1799B - Equalize by DivideIf all numbers are equal initially — we can do nothing.Otherwise if some ai=1, answer do not exist: this ai can't became bigger during operations and all other elements can't be equal to 1 simultaniously, because after the last operation aj>1 (otherwise we can remove this operation).If all ai≥2, the answer exists and we can simulate such algorithm: let's take i, such that ai is maximum possible and j, such that aj is smallest possible. Make operation with (i,j). Note, that after at most 30n operations all elements will be equal.It is true, because after each operation ai decreases at least by 2 times (and rounded up) and all elements are bounded ax≥2 after each operation. Each number can't be decreased more than 30 times.Time complexity: O(n2logC), where C=109.
