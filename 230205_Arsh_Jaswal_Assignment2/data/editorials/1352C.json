    "solution": "1352C - K-th Not Divisible by nSuppose the answer is just k-th positive integer which we should \"shift right\" by some number. Each multiplier of n shifts our answer by 1. The number of such multipliers is need=⌊k−1n−1⌋, where ⌊xy⌋ is x divided by y rounded down. So the final answer is k+need (k-th positive integer with the required number of skipped integers multipliers of n).You can also use a binary search to solve this problem :) Solution#include <bits/stdc++.h>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n\tint t;\n\tcin >> t;\n\twhile (t--) {\n\t\tint n, k;\n\t\tcin >> n >> k;\n\t\tint need = (k - 1) / (n - 1);\n\t\tcout << k + need << endl;\n\t}\n}"
