    "solution": "1181A - Chunga-Changa  It's easy to calculate how much coconuts we will buy: k=⌊x+yz⌋ (suppose that all money transferred to a single person, this way the number of bought coconuts would be clearly maximal)  If k=⌊xz⌋+⌊yz⌋, then the answer is ⟨k,0⟩. The remaining case is a bit harder.  Let's notice, that there is no need to transfer ≥z chizhiks, since the one transferring money could have used z chizhiks to buy one more coconut herself.  Also it's optimal to transfer coins such that the remainder modulo z of the receiving part will turn to be exactly zero (we could have simply transfer less for the same effect).  So the answer is ⟨k,min(z−(xmodz),z−(ymodz))⟩.  "
