    "solution": "1266B - Dice TowerConsider a die other than the top-most one. As the sum of numbers on the opposite faces of a die is always 7, the sum of numbers on the visible faces is always 14, regardless of its orientation.For the top-most die, the numbers on the sides also add up to 14, and there is an additional number on top of the die. The total number of visible pips is thus 14d+t, where d is the number of dice and t is the number on top. For a given x, compute t=xmod14 and d=⌊x14⌋. The answer is positive if and only if d≥1 and 1≤t≤6.  "
