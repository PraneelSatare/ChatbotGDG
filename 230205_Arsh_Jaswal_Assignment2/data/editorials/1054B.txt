1054B - Appending MexIldar has written an array correctly if there exists numbers 0,1,…,ai−1 to the left of ai for all i. This is equivalent to ai≤max(−1,a1,a2,…,ai−1)+1 for all i. If this condition is false for some i we made a mistake.So the solution is to check that ai≤max(−1,a1,a2,…,ai−1)+1 in the increasing order of i. If it is false i is answer. If it is always true answer is −1.Time complexity: O(n). Jury's solution: 44522430
