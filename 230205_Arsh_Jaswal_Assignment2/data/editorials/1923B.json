    "solution": "1923B - Monsters Attack!Let's look at monsters at distance of 1 (i. e. in positions 1 and −1). We must kill them in the 1-st second, so their total hp (let denote it as s1) should not exceed k. If this condition is not met, the answer is NO. Otherwise, we can say that there are k−s1 bullets left unused during the first second (let denote it as lft). Now let's look at the monsters at a distance of 2. We must kill them no later than the 2-nd second. We have k bullets for the 2-nd second plus lft unused bullets from the 1-st second, so total hp of monsters at distance 2 should not exceed k+lft. We can see that the situation is similar to the 1-st second, if the condition is not met, then the answer is NO, otherwise we move on to the next distance with the updated value of lft.If all n seconds are considered and all conditions are met, then the answer is YES.Therefore, we got a solution that works in O(n).
