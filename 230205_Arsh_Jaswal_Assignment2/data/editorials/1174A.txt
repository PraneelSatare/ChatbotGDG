1174A - Ehab Fails to Be ThanosIf all elements in the array are equal, there's no solution. Otherwise, sort the array. The sum of the second half will indeed be greater than that of the first half.Another solution is to see if they already have different sums. If they do, print the array as it is. Otherwise, find any pair of different elements from different halves and swap them.Code link: https://pastebin.com/FDXTuDdZ
