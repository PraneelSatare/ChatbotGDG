1265A - Beautiful StringIf string s initially contains 2 equal consecutive letters ("aa", "bb" or "cc") then the answer is obviously -1. Otherwise, it is always possible to replacing all characters '?' to make s beautiful. We will replacing one '?' at a time and in any order (from left to right for example). For each '?', since it is adjacent to at most 2 other characters and we have 3 options ('a', 'b' and 'c') for this '?', there always exists at least one option which differ from 2 characters that are adjacent with this '?'. Simply find one and replace '?' by it.Time comlexity: O(n) where n is length of s. Python SolutionT = int(input())
for tc in range(T):
    s = [c for c in input()]
    n = len(s)
    i = 0
    while (i < n):
        if (s[i] == '?'):
            prv = 'd' if i == 0 else s[i - 1]
            nxt = 'e' if i + 1 >= n else s[i + 1]
            for x in ['a', 'b', 'c']:
                if (x != prv) and (x != nxt):
                    s[i] = x
                    break
        else:
            i += 1
           
    ok = True 
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if (s[i] == s[i + 1]):
            print("-1")
            ok = False
            break
    if (ok == True):
