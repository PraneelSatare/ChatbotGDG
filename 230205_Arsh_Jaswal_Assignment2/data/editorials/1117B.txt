1117B - EmotesIt is obvious that we always can use only two emotes with maximum ai. Let their values be x and y (x≥y).We have to solve the problem by some formula. The best way to use emotes — use the emote with the value x k times, then use the emotion with the value y, then again use the emote with value x k times, and so on.So the "cycle" has length k+1, and we can use the emote with the value x the remaining number of times. So the answer is ⌊mk+1⌋⋅(x⋅k+y)+(m%(k+1))⋅x, where x is the first maximum of a, y is the second maximum of a, ⌊pq⌋ is p divided by q rounded down, and p%q is p modulo q.
