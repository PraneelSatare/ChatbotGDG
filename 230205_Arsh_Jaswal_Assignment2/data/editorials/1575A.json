    "solution": "1575A. Another Sorting ProblemAuthor: hockyDeveloper: richiesenliaEditorialist: hocky IdeaObserve that the even-indexed character of the string can be transformed from A-Z to Z-A. E.g. for the first example:  AA → AZ AB → AY BB → BY BA → BZ AZ → AA Now, you can use any known algorithms to sort the string as usual. You can sort it in linear time with trie, or std::sort in O(nmlogn) time.Time Complexity : O(nm) or O(nmlogn)"
