    "solution": "1339B - Sorted Adjacent DifferencesSort the list, and make an oscillation centered on middle element like picture below.  In this way, you will always achieve to make |ai−ai+1|≤|ai+1−ai+2| for all i. Time complexity is O(nlogn).Behind story of B:  I tried to block various heuristics. There were some critical heuristics which could pass so many cases. Fortunately I blocked them during testing period, so I hope there won't be much FST this time.  "
