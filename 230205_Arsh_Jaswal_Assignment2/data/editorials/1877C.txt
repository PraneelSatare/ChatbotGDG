1877C - JoyboardThere are only a few cases.   If an+1=0, then every value of ai is 0. So there is only 1 distinct value.  If 1≤an+1≤n, then there exists an index p (p=an+1) such that ai=an+1 for all indices p+1≤i≤n+1 and ai=0 for all 1≤i≤p. So there are 2 distinct values.  If an+1>n and an+1 is divisible by n, then an=0 and all values to the left of that are also 0. So there are 2 distinct values.  If an+1>n and an+1 is not divisible by n, then 1≤an≤n−1. This is is equivalent to case 2, which means that there are 2 distinct values from index 1 to n. So in total, there are 3 distinct values. So the number of ways is as follows:   If k=1, there is always 1 way, since m≥0.  If k=2 and m≤n, there are m ways.  If k=2 and m>n, there are n+⌊m−nn⌋.  If k=3 and m≤n, there are 0 ways.  If k=3 and m>n, there are m−n−⌊m−nn⌋.  If k>3, there are 0 ways. Time complexity for each test case: O(1)2D/1B. Effects of Anti PimplesAuthor: PyqeDeveloper: Pyqe  Tutorial
