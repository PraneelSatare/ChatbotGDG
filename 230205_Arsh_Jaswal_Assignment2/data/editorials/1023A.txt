1023A - Single Wildcard Pattern MatchingIf there is no wildcard character in the string s, the answer is "YES" if and only if strings s and t are equal. In the other case let's do the following thing: while both strings are not empty and their last characters are equal, let's erase them. Then do the same for the first characters, i.e. while both strings are not empty and their first characters are equal, let's erase them. Now if s is empty or s="*" the answer is "YES", otherwise the answer is "NO".Problem idea: MikeMirzayanov, awoo; prepared by: vovuh.
