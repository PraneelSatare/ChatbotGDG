1523B - Lord of the ValuesNotice that for transforming any pair of numbers (a,b) into a pair (−a,−b) a sequence of operations such as (1,2,1,2,1,2) can be performed. Since n is even we can apply this sequence of operations for all pairs of numbers (ai⋅2−1,ai⋅2) for all i from 1 to n2.Final complexity: O(n).Prepared by AleXman111.
