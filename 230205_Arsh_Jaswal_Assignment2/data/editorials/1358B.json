    "solution": "1358B - Maria Breaks the Self-isolationLet x be the maximum number of grannies that can go out to the yard. Then if Maria Ivanovna calls them all at the same time, then everyone will see x grannies. Since x is the maximum answer, then each granny of them satisfy ai≤x (otherwise there's no way for these grannies to gather in the yard), that is, such call is correct. So it is always enough to call once.Note that if you order grannies by ai, Maria Ivanovna will have to call x first grannies from this list. She can take x grannies if ax≤x (otherwise, after all x grannies arrived, the last one will leave). To find x we can do a linear search.The overall compexity is O(nlogn) per test.
