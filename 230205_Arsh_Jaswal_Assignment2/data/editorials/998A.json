Then one of the following holds:  Either n=1, and then there is no solution  Or n=2, and other element is equal to minimum, in this case it is ease to see that there are not solution too. Also, the limits were set in such way, that solution which bruteforces all 2n subsets and checks them also passes.Author â€” MikeMirzayanov "
