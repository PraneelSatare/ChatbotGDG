    "solution": "1702D - Not a Cheap StringThe main idea is that it is always better to remove the most expensive symbol. To do this quickly, we will count all the symbols and remove them from the most expensive to the cheapest, counting how many times we have removed each. During the output, we will skip the characters the number of times that we deleted.
