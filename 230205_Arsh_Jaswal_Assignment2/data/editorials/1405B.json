    "solution": "1405B - Array CancellationThe answer is the maximum suffix sum, which can be computed in O(n).Formal proof.Define ci=ai+ai+1+⋯+an (partial suffix sum). Note M=max(c).We can observe that a1=⋯=an=0 if and only if c1=⋯=cn=0. (If c is null, ai=ci−ci+1=0−0=0.)A free operation on i<j is equivalent to incrementing ci+1,…,cj. Free operations can only increment elements of c, so we obviously need at least M coins.Let's do M times the operation (i=n,j=1), which decrement every element M times. Now, for every i, ci≤0 and we can make it equal to 0 by performing −ci times the free operation (i−1,i).Implementation"
