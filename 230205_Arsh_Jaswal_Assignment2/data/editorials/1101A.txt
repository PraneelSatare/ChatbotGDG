1101A - Minimum IntegerThere are two basic cases we have to consider: either the element we want to find is less than li, or it is greater than ri.In the first case, we are interested in di itself: it is the minimum positive number divisible by di, and if it is less than li, then it is the answer.In the second case, we have to find minimum element that is greater than ri and is divisible by di. This can be done as follows: we calculate the number of elements divisible by di that are not greater than ri as c=⌊ridi⌋, and then we take (c+1)-th element, which is di(c+1). Solution (BledDest)q = int(input())
for i in range(q):
    l, r, d = map(int, input().split())
    if(d < l or d > r):
        print(d)
    else:
        print((r // d) * d + d)
