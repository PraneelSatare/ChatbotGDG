1891B - Deja VuLet a number be divisible by 2x. Then after applying the operation it is no longer divisible by 2x. From this we can conclude that if we apply the operation xi, and there is such an operation j<i that xj<xi, then the operation xi does not change the array. So, it is useless and can be simply not processed. Then we will maintain the minimum of the processed x. If the new operation is smaller than the minimum processed one, we will process the operation and update it. Otherwise we just won't do anything. Since the minimum processed will decrease at most 30 times, the time complexity is O(30â‹…n).
