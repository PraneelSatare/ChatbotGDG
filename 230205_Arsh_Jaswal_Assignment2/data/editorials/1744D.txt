1744D - Divisibility by 2^nLet's notice that if we multiply the numbers a1⋅a2⋅…⋅an, then the power of two of the product is equal to the sum of the powers of two in each of the numbers.Let's calculate the initial sum of the powers of twos in the product. This can be done as follows: let's take the element ai and divide it by 2 as long as we can, while remembering to increase our counter by the number of occurrences of a power of two.Now let's move on to operations and note that choosing the index i will increase the degree of occurrence of two by a fixed number (that is, it does not matter when to apply this operation). Choosing an index i will increment the counter by a number x such that i is divisible by 2x but not by 2x+1 — you can find this x, again , by dividing by 2 while we can.Since we want to minimize the number of operations used, at each moment of time we will try to use an index that increases the counter by the largest number. To do this, it is enough to sort the indices by this index of increase and take them greedily from the largest increase to the smallest.We get the solution in O(nlogn+nlogA).
