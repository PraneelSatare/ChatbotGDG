1995B1 - Bouquet (Easy Version) HintFor each number of petals, we can bruteforce the answer for x,x+1 SolutionFirst, we can aggregate number of flowers with x petals into cx (for example, sort the array and then create array of pairs (x,cx), where cx is the length of segment with elements equal to x). Note that ∑xcx=n. Also note that for every x we won't need more than ⌊mx⌋ flowers (otherwise total number of petals will exceed m).Then we iterate through all x. Suppose that we want to assemble a bouquet with x,x+1 petals. We can bruteforce the amount of flowers with x petals in O(cx). If we have 0≤k1≤min(cx,⌊mx⌋) flowers with x petals, we already have k1∗x petals. There are still m−k1∗x coins which we can spend for flowers with x+1 petals. There are at most k2=min(cx+1,⌊m−k1∗xx+1⌋) flowers with x+1 petal we can buy. So we need to find maximum over all such k1∗x+k2∗(x+1). Total complexity is O(∑xcx)=O(n) for finding the maximum and O(nlogn) for sorting. Code272263831
