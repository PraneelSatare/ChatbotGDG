    "solution": "1581B - Diameter of Graphidea: CQXYMpreparation: CQXYMtutorial: CQXYMIf m<n−1, the graph can't be connected, so the answer should be No.If m>n(n−1)2, the graph must contaion multiedges, so the answer should be No.If m=n(n−1)2, the graph must be a complete graph. The diameter of the graph is 1. If k>2 the answer is YES, otherwise the answer is NO.If n=1, the graph has only one node, and its diameter is 0. If k>1 the answer is YES, otherwise the answer is NO.If m=n−1, the graph must be a tree, the diameter of the tree is at least 2 when it comes to each node has an edge with node 1. If m>n−1∧m<n(n−1)2, we can add edges on the current tree and the diameter wouldn't be more than 2. Since the graph is not complete graph, the diameter is more than 1, the diameter is just 2. If k>3 the answer is YES, otherwise the answer is NO.The time complexity is O(t).  solution#include<stdio.h>\ninline void Solve(){\n\tint n,m,k;\n\tscanf(\"%d%d%d\",&n,&m,&k);\n\tif((n-1ll)*n>>1<m||m<n-1){\n\t\tputs(\"NO\");\n\t\treturn;\n\t}\n\tif(n==1){\n\t\tif(k>1){\n\t\t\tputs(\"YES\");\n\t\t}else{\n\t\t\tputs(\"NO\");\n\t\t}\n\t}else if(m<(n-1ll)*n>>1){\n\t\tif(k>3){\n\t\t\tputs(\"YES\");\n\t\t}else{\n\t\t\tputs(\"NO\");\n\t\t}\n\t}else if(k>2){\n\t\tputs(\"YES\");\n\t}else{\n\t\tputs(\"NO\");\n\t}\n}\nint main(){\n\tint t;\n\tscanf(\"%d\",&t);\n\tfor(register int i=0;i!=t;i++){\n\t\tSolve();\n\t}\n\treturn 0;\n}"
