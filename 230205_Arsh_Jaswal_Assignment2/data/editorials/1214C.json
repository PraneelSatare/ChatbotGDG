    "solution": "1214C - Bad SequenceLet's call a balance of bracket sequence a number of opening brackets minus the number of closing brackets. Correct bracket sequence is such a sequence that balance of any of its prefixes is at least 0 and the balance of the entire sequence is equal to 0. To solve the problem let's consider the shortest prefix with balance equal to −1. In this prefix last symbol is obviously equal to \")\", so let's move this closing bracket to the end of the sequence. If the sequence is correct now, then the answer is \"Yes\", otherwise it is \"No\", because it means that in original sequence there exists some longer prefix with balance equal to −2. Let's show why we can't move some bracket so that the sequence becomes correct.Consider the shortest prefix with balance equal to −2. If we move some opening bracket to the beginning of the sequence, balance of considered prefix becomes −1 and the sequence is not correct yet. Moving opening bracket from considered prefix to the beginning doesn't change anything. Even more, if we move the closing bracket from the end of the considered prefix to the end of the sequence, it still doesn't become correct, because balance of the prefix is −1.This results in a following solution: if balance of all prefixes is not less than −1, answer is \"Yes\", otherwise it's \"No\".
