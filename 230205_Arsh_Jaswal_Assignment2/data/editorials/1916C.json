    "solution": "1916C - Training Before the OlympiadNote that our operation replaces two numbers with their sum if they are of the same parity, and with their sum −1 otherwise. Therefore, the second player needs to perform as many operations as possible where an even and an odd number are used. Also, note that on any move of the second player, there will be at least one even number that the first player made on the previous move. Then our task for the first player is to remove two odd numbers as often as possible. It can also be observed that the number of odd numbers in the array does not decrease, which means all operations with two odd numbers will go before operations with two even numbers. And after each such move, the second player will remove one odd number from the array. That is, in two moves, the number of odd numbers decreases by 3. Let's consider all possible remainders of the number of odd numbers modulo 3. If the remainder is 0, then the answer is sum−cnt3, where sum is the sum of all numbers. If the remainder modulo is 1, then two situations are possible: when the size of the array is 1 — then the answer is the single number in the array. Otherwise, at the moment when there is 1 odd number left, there will be one more move of player number 2, which means he will reduce the total sum once more, and the answer will be sum−⌊cnt3⌋−1. If the remainder modulo is 2, then the number of moves when the second player reduces the sum does not change, so the answer is sum−⌊cnt3⌋.author: OR_LOVe, developer: zwezdinv "
