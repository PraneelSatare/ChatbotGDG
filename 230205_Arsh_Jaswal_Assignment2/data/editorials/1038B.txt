1038B - Non-Coprime PartitionThere are many ways to solve this question. The easiest way perhaps was to note that the sum of first n numbers is given by n∗(n+1)2, and one of n2 or n+12 has to be an integer, suppose k. Then we can partition the numbers into two sets, one containing k and the other containing the remaining integers, both of which will have k as a common factor.
