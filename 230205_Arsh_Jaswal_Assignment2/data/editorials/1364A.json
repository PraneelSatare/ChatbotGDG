    "solution": "1364A - XXXXXLet's start with the whole array. If every element in it is divisible by x, the answer is âˆ’1; if its sum isn't divisible by x, the answer is n. Otherwise, we must remove some elements. The key idea is that removing an element that is divisible by x doesn't do us any benefits, but once we remove an element that isn't, the sum won't be divisible by x. So let the first non-multiple of x be at index l, and the last one be at index r. We must either remove the prefix all the way up to l or the suffix all the way up to r, and we'll clearly remove whichever shorter.Code link: https://pastebin.com/j2Y8AJBAAlternatively, we can notice that this means the answer is either a prefix or a suffix, so we can simply bruteforce them all."
