    "solution": "2009C - The Legend of Freya the FrogProblem Credits: Proof_by_QED  Analysis: cry Solution Consider the x and y directions separately and calculate the jumps we need in each direction. The number of jumps we need in the x direction is ⌈xk⌉ and similarily ⌈yk⌉ in the y direction. Now let's try to combine them to obtain the total number of jumps. Let's consider the following cases:  ⌈yk⌉≥⌈xk⌉. In this case, there will need to be ⌈yk⌉−⌈xk⌉ extra jumps in the y direction. While Freya performs these extra jumps, she will choose d=0 for the x direction. In total, there will need to be 2⋅⌈yk⌉ jumps. ⌈xk⌉>⌈yk⌉. We can use the same reasoning as the previous case, but there's a catch. Since Freya is initially facing the x direction, for the last jump, she does not need to jump in the y direction. In total, there will need to be 2⋅⌈xk⌉−1 jumps.  Code (Python) (ntarsis30)for _ in range(int(input())):\n    x,y,k = map(int,input().split())\n    print(max(2*((x+k-1)//k)-1,2*((y+k-1)//k)))"
