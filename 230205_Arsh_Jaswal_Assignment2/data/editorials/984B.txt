984B - MinesweeperLet's make two-dimensional array d[n][m]. For each cell i,j if it has bomb in it we add 1 in d[g][h] where g,h is neighboring cell for i,j. Now d[i][j] is a number of bombs in neighboring cells of i,j and we can check validity of field according to the condition of the problem:   If there is a number k in the cell, then exacly k of neighboring cells have bombs.  Otherwise, if cell has no bomb, then neighboring cells have no bombs. Solution
