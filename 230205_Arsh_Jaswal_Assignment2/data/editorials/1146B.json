    "solution": "1146B - Hate \"A\"There are a few different ways to approach this.In one way, we can approach it by looking at the frequency of all characters. We want to find a split point so that all \"a\"s lie on the left side of the split, and all other characters are split evenly between the left and right side. This split can be uniquely determined and found in linear time by keeping track of prefix sums (it also might be possible there is no split, in which case the answer is impossible). After finding a split, we still need to make sure the characters appear in the same order, which is another linear time pass.In another way, let's count the number of \"a\" and non-\"a\" characters. Let these numbers be c0 and c1. If c1 is not divisible by 2, then the answer is impossible. Otherwise, we know the suffix of length c1/2 of t must be sâ€², and we can check there are no \"a\"s there. We also check that after removing all \"a\"s from t, the first and second half of the strings are equal.First solve: tourist, 00:02:37 Tree Diameter"
