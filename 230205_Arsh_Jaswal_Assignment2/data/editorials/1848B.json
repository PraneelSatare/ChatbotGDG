    "solution": "1848B - Vika and the BridgeIn a single linear pass through the array, let's calculate, for each color, the lengths of the two maximum steps between planks of that color. To do this, we will maintain when we last encountered that color.Now we need to consider that we can repaint one of the planks. Let's say we repaint a plank in color c. It is easy to notice that we should repaint the plank in the middle of the longest step between planks of color c. After all, if we don't repaint such a plank, we will still have to make that longest step.Therefore, the answer for a fixed color will be the maximum of two values: half the length of the longest step between planks of that color, and the length of the second largest step between planks of that color.Knowing the answer for each individual color, we can determine the answer to the problem. To do this, we just need to take the minimum of the answers for all colors.
