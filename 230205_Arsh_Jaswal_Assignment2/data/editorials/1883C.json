    "solution": "1883C - RaspberriesLet's notice that if k=2,3,5, since these are prime numbers, the product of the numbers will be divisible by k if any number in the array is divisible by k. From this, we can conclude that it is advantageous to perform operations only on one number.If k=4, we have several cases, and we need to take the minimum among them. Again, we can perform operations on one number and make it divisible by 4, or we need to perform operations such that there are two even numbers in the array (there is a special case when n=1). To have two even numbers, let's count the number of even numbers in the original array as cnt, and if 2≤n, we can say that the answer is max(0,2−cnt). "
