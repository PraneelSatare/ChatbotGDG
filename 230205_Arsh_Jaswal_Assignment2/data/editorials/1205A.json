    "solution": "1205A - Almost EqualConsider a valid arrangement for some n. We denote Si=ai+ai+1+ai+2+⋯+ai+n−1 for each i from 1 to 2n, where at+2n=at. Then we have: Si+1−Si=(ai+1+ai+2+ai+3+⋯+ai+n)−(ai+ai+1+ai+2+⋯+ai+n−1)=ai+n−ai. Hence |ai+n−ai|≤1. Since ai+n and ai are different, |ai+n−ai|= 1.It is also clear from this that ai+n−ai and ai+n+1−ai+1 have opposite signs: if they were both equal to 1, we would get Si+2−Si=(Si+2−Si+1)+(Si+1−Si)=(ai+n+1−ai+1)+(ai+n−ai)= 2, similarly with −1. Thus, the values ​​ai+n−ai for i from 1 to 2n shoul be 1 and −1 alternating, and this is a sufficient condition.Now, if n is even, we get a contradiction, since ai+n−ai=−(a(i+n)+n−ai+n), but due to the alternating they must be equal.If n is odd, then it's now easy to build an example: for i from 1 to n ai=2i−1, ai=2i, if i is even, and ai=2i , ai=2i−1 if i is odd.Asymptotics O(n).Challenge:For which pairs of (n,k) (n>k≥1) is there an arrangement of numbers from 1 to n on a circle such that the sums of each k consecutive numbers differ by not more than 1 ?
