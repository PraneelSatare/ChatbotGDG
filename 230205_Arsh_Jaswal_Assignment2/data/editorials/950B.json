It's easy to see that if two first conditions are true then the third are true too because  and because of this fact and condition from statement  answer is a number of non-empty prefixes with the same sum.Time complexity is  if you use two pointers or  if you use some data structure.BONUS (easy): You lost one block from second message and you interested in maximal possible number of files if you can insert this block anywhere in second message. In this case it graduated that .(Idea — meshanya, developing — Zlobober, KAN) "
