1804B - ВакцинацияObservation 1. There exists an optimal answer where each pack of vaccine is used for a consecutive segment of patients. Indeed, if there are three patients a<b<c such that a and c are vaccinated using the dose from one pack and b is vaccinated using the dose from the other pack we can swap the packs used for b and c and the answer will still be valid.Observation 2. It always makes sense to ask new patients to wait as long as possible before opening a new pack.From these two observations we derive a very easy strategy. Consider patients one by one in order of non-decreasing ti. If we consider some patient i and there is an open pack that still valid and still has some doses remaining, use it immediately. If there is no valid open pack of vaccines and there is no one waiting, ask patient i to wait till ti+w moment of time. If there is no valid pack of vaccines, but there is someone already waiting for moment x, ask patient i to wait for moment x as well.As a courtesy to our participants the values of d and w are limited by 106 to avoid a potential overflow of a signed 32-bit integer type.
