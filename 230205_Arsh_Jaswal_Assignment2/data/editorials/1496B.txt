1496B - Max and MexLet a=max(S),b=mex(S).When k=0, the answer is n.Otherwise if b>a, then b=a+1 , so ⌈a+b2⌉=b . It's not hard to find out that max(S∪{b})=b,mex(S∪{b})=b+1, so the set S always satisfies max(S)+1=mex(S). So the answer is n+k when b=a+1.Otherwise b<a. So b<a⇒2b<a+b⇒a+b2>b⇒⌈a+b2⌉>b. In that case mex(S)=b is always true. So the element we add in all operations is always ⌈a+b2⌉. Just check whether it is in S at first.The time complexity is O(n) or O(nlogn) for each test case depending on your implementation. Solution (waaitg)109637470
