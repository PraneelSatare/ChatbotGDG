1863C - MEX RepetitionAppend the initial array a1,…,an with an+1=MEX(a1,…,an). It is easy to see that a1,…,an+1 is a permutation of 0,1,…,n. In this case setting ai=MEX(a1,…,an) is basically equivalent ai=an+1, but after this the new MEX(a1,…,an) is changed. In fact, it becomes equal to the old value of ai, since this value is not now present in the array.In other words, performing the operation on ai is equivalent to swapping ai and an+1. Performing the operation on i=1,2,…,n can be viewed as n swaps. It means that the array changes from [a1,a2,…,an+1] to [an+1,a1,a2,…,an], i. e. we simply perform the cyclic shift to the right.To finish up the solution, first, calculate an+1=MEX(a1,…,an) (you can do so, for example, by setting an+1=n(n+1)2−∑i=1nai). Second, calculate k%(n+1) and then perform the cyclic shift in O(n).
