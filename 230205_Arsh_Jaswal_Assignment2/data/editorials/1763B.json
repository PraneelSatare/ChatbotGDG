Solution 1Sort the monsters in ascending order of their powers.Now we iterate through the monsters while maintaining the current attack power and the total damage dealt.Only the monsters with health greater than the total damage dealt are considered alive, and every time we encounter such a monster it will be the weakest one at the current time, thus we need to attack until the total damage dealt exceeds the current monster's health while lowering our attack power by its power each time.If we can kill all the monsters in this way, the answer is YES, otherwise it is NO.Time Complexity: O(nlogn) Sort by power solutionCode Author: DreadArceus Solution 2Sort the monsters in ascending order of their health.Now we maintain a count of monsters alive after each attack. This could be achieved by applying upperbound() on h array for each attack. The total damage dealt could be stored and updated in a separate variable.To find the power of the weakest monster alive, we could just precompute the minimum power of monsters in a suffix array. In other words, pi=min(pi,pi+1).Time Complexity: O(nlogn) Sort by health solutionCode Author: og_"
