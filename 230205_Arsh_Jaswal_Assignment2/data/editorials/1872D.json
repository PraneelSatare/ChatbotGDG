    "solution": "1872D - Plus Minus PermutationLet's call a number red if it is divisible by x.Let's call a number blue if it is divisible by y.Let's call a number purple if it is both red and blue at the same time.The score of a permutation, by definition, is the sum of pi for all red numbers i from 1 to n, minus the sum of pi for all blue numbers i from 1 to n.It is easy to see that pi at purple indices i does not affect the score of the permutation: they are included in the sum once with a plus sign and once with a minus sign.Therefore, the score of the permutation is the sum of pi for \"red but not purple indices\" minus the sum of pi for \"blue but not purple indices\".Notice that the set of \"red but not purple indices\" and the set of \"blue but not purple indices\" cannot intersect, because if they had a common index, it would be purple.Therefore, it is obviously optimal to place the largest numbers possible on \"red but not purple indices\" and the smallest numbers possible on \"blue but not purple indices\".To calculate the number of indices that are \"red but not purple\", we can calculate the number of red indices and subtract the number of purple indices.The number of red indices is ⌊nx⌋, and the number of blue indices is calculated similarly.To calculate the number of purple indices, we need to notice that the condition \"index is divisible by both x and y\" is equivalent to \"index is divisible by lcm(x,y)\", where lcm denotes the least common multiple. Therefore, the number of purple indices is ⌊nlcm(x,y)⌋.Let R be the number of \"red but not purple\" indices, and let B be the number of \"blue but not purple\" indices. Then it is not difficult to see that the maximum score is (n+(n−1)+…+(n−(R−1))−(1+2+…+B).To quickly find this sum, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression: l+(l+1)+…+r=(l+r)⋅(r−l+1)2 Solution222362817"
