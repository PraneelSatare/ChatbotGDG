1474B - Different DivisorsHint 1: Integer have exactly 4 divisors, if it is of form pq or p3 for some primes p and q. In the first case it have divisors 1, p, q, pq. In the second case it have divisors 1, p, p2, p3.Hint 2: Instead of finding integer with at least 4 divisors, find integer with exactly 4 divisors.Hint 3: Let p be the smallest prime factor of a. Then, p≥d+1.Solution:Suppose, we have integer a with more than 4 divisors (and satisfies the other condition). If a has at least two different prime factors, we can throw out all other prime factors and get a smaller number with at least 4 divisors. Otherwise, a=pk for some k>3. p3 will also have 4 divisors and it will be smaller than a. When we throw out a prime factor, no new divisors will appear, so the difference between any two of them will be at least d.Let's find smallest integers of form p3 and pq (p<q) independently.In the first case, p3−p2>p2−p>p−1, because p≥2. If we will find the smallest p≥d+1 all conditions will be satisfied.In the second case, 1<p<q<pq. Let's find the smallest p≥d+1 and the smallest q≥d+p. In this case it is easy to see that p−1≥d and q−p≥d. Also, pq−q=q(p−1)≥qd≥d since q≥2. It is enough to get OK even without checking case a=p3.Also we should prove that there cannot exist p′ and q′ such that p′q′<pq. It is true because p′ should be at least d+1 and it should be prime, but p is the smallest prime greater than d, so p′≥p. And q′ should be at least p+d and we can prove that q′≥q in the same way.Time complexity is O(t⋅gap⋅primecheck), where gap is difference between primes and O(loga) in average and primecheck is complexity of your prime check and usually is O(a−−√).Answer for d=10000 is near to 2⋅108, so naive solution with factorization of each number shouldn't pass, but it is possible to precompute answers for all values of d by that solution (in this case, you should run solution once for all values of d, not once for each value of d).
