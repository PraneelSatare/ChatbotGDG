    "solution": "1685A - Циклический локальный минимаксLet's call bi local minimum if bi−1>bi<bi+1 and local maximum if bi−1<bi>bi+1. It's clear that in the arrangement satisfying the conditions from the statement, if bi is a local minimum, bi+1 is a local maximum, and vice versa. Local minimums and local maximums will be alternating.Then it's easy to see that such an arrangement can't exist for odd n. Indeed, suppose that the conditions from the statement are satisfied for b1,b2,…,bn. If we suppose that b1 is local minimum, we get that b2 is local maximum, b3 is local minimum, …,, bn is local minimum, b1 is local maximum. Clearly, b1 can't be a local maximum and a local minimum at the same time, leading to a contradiction.Let's now consider the case of even n=2m. Sort the array a, so that a1≤a2≤…≤a2m. Let's show that if ai=ai+m−1=x for some 2≤i≤m−1, then there is no arrangement satisfying the conditions from the statement. Indeed, consider such an arrangement: we have m numbers x, and no two of them can be adjacent, so they occupy every second position. In addition, as local maximums and local minimums are alternating, we get that all x are local maximums or all x are local minimums. The first would imply that a2m<x, which isn't possible. The second would imply that a1>x, which isn't possible.It turns out that if there is no such i, the arrangement exists. Indeed, we can arrange numbers on the circle in the following order: (a1,am+1,a2,am+2,…,am,a2m). Here ak<am+k>ak+1 for 1≤k≤m−1, am+k>ak+1<am+k+1 for 1≤k≤m−1, a2m>a1<am+1 and am<a2m>a1. D2D/D1B"
