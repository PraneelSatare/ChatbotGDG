    "solution": "1927C - Choose the Different Ones!Notice that elements with a value greater than k are not relevant to us. Let's divide the values into three categories:  Occurring only in array a;  occurring only in array b;  occurring in both arrays. The answer will be NO if any of the following conditions are met:  the number of values of the first type is greater than k2 (this implies that we cannot select all such elements);  the number of values of the second type is greater than k2 (this implies that we cannot select all such elements);  the total number of values of all three types is less than k (this implies that some values do not occur in either of the arrays). Otherwise, the answer is YES.
