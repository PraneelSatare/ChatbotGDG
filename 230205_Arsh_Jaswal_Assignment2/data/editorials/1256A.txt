1256A - Payment Without ChangeFirstly, we obviously need to take at least S%n coins of value 1. If we cannot do it, the answer it NO. Otherwise we always can obtain the required sum S if a⋅n+b≥S. Solution#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	int q;
	cin >> q;

	for (int qr = 0; qr < q; ++qr) {
		int a, b, n, s;
		cin >> a >> b >> n >> s;

		if (s % n <= b && 1ll * a * n + b >= s) {
			cout << "YES\n";
		}
		else {
			cout << "NO\n";
		}
	}
}
