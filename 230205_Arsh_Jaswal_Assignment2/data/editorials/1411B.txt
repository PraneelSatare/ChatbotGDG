1411B - Fair NumbersLet's call a number super-fair if it is divisible by each of the numbers 1..9. It is fair to say that super-fair numbers are also divisible by LCM(1..9) which is equal to 2520. The answer isn't larger than the nearest super-fair number, which means that you can increase the original n by one until it becomes fair. We will determine if the number is fair by checking each of its digits separately.
