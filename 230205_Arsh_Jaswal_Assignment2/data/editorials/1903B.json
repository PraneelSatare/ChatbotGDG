    "solution": "1903B - StORage roomSolution:Initially, we set all ai=230−1 (all bits on).You can through every i,j such that i≠j and do ai&=Mi,j and aj&=Mi,j.Then we check if Mi,j=ai|aj for all pairs. If this holds you found the array else the answer is NO.Proof:Initially, all elements have all their bits set on and we remove only the bits that affect our answer. If Mi,j doesn't have a specific bit then definitely neither ai nor aj should have it. If Mi,j has a specific bit on then we don't have to remove anything (in the end we want at least one of ai and aj to have the bit on).
