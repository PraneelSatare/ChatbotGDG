    "solution": "1421B â€” Putting Bricks in the WallIdea: flaviu2001, solution: flaviu2001 and stefdasca HintIt's hard to use the two valuable switches somewhere in the middle of the matrix, a much wiser choice would be to somehow block the S cell or the F cell. Perhaps you can set both neighbours of S to 1 to force Roger to pick 1. SolutionIf we pick the neighbours of S to be 1 we can make the neighbours of F 0 and there would be no way to go from S to F. But this requires in the worst case 4 switches, which is not good enough. Luckily, in order to get down to 2 switches we only have to consider the other way around, making the squares neighboring S become 0 and the squares neighboring F 1. There must be a solution of the two with at most two switches and you won't get from S to F since you're forced to pick 1 (or 0) and can't get past the neighbours of F which are opposite."
