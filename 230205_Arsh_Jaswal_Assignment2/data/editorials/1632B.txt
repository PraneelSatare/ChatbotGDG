1632B — Roof Construction Hint 1The cost of construction is a power of two. Hint 2The cost of construction is 2k, where k is the highest set bit in n−1. SolutionLet k be the highest set bit in n−1. There will always be a pair of adjacent elements where one of them has the k-th bit set and the other one doesn't, so the cost is at least 2k. A simple construction that reaches it is 2k−1, 2k−2, …, 0, 2k, 2k+1, …, n−1.Time complexity: O(n)Bonus: count the number of permutations with the minimum cost. Solution codes C++ code. Python code.
