1979C - Earning on Bets HintTry to come up with a condition for the existence of an answer. SolutionLet S be the total amount of coins placed on all possible outcomes. Then, if the coefficient for winning is ki, we have to place more than Ski on this outcome.We can obtain the following inequality:  ∑ni=1Ski<S.Dividing both sides by S, we obtain the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an answer:  ∑ni=11ki<1.This check can be performed by reducing all fractions to a common denominator. Notice that the numerators of the reduced fractions correspond to the required bets on the outcomes. Code#include <bits/stdc++.h>
