1800D - Remove Two LettersConsider deleting characters with numbers i and i+1, as well as characters with numbers i+1 and i+2. In the first case, the symbol with the number i+2 remains, in the second - i. Symbols with numbers less than i or more than i+2 remain in both cases. Therefore, the same strings will be obtained if the characters with the numbers i and i+2 match. Therefore, we just need to count the number of i:1≤i≤n−2:si=si+2, and subtract this value from n−1.
