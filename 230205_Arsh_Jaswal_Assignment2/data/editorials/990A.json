    "solution": "990A - Commentary BoxesNotice that you need to check just two numbers: the closest one less or equal to n and the closest one greater than n. Distances to them are (nmodm) and (mâˆ’(nmodm)) respectively. Now you should multiply the first result by b, the second result by a and compare the products.Overall complexity: O(1).
