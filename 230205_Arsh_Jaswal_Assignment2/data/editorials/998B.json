    "solution": "998B - CuttingIt is possible to proof, that cut after i-th number can be done if and only if the prefix of length i contains equal number of odd and even numbers.This way each cut can be done or not done independently of all other cuts (except the budget issue).Why it is true?Let's proof that criterion is sufficient. If you make some set of cuts, where each cut is valid according to criterion above, than the result would be correct — each part of result lies between to cuts, and if prefixes which correspond to cuts have same number of odds-evens, than the part between also will have these numbers equal.Let's show that the condition is required — if there is some set of cuts, which produces correct parts, than each part has same number of odds-evens, and than all prefixes, which correspond to cuts also have the same number of odds-evens.This way each cut can be done independently, so you can identify all valid cuts, order them by cut-price, and take greedy from the beginning of the list while the budget allows.Author — 300iq "
