1996C - SortProblem Credits: cry  Analysis: cry Solution For two strings to be the same after sorting, they must have the same occurrences of every possible lowercase letter. To answer the query for a range [l,r], we must ensure that after the operations, cntc=cnt2c must where cntc is the number of times character c occurs in the range for a and cnt2c is defined similarly for b. Both cntc and cnt2c can be obtained by doing prefix sums for character c specifically. Note that since there are only 26 possible c, you can afford to create 26 length n prefix sum arrays.In one operation, you can replace one occurrence of a character c with another character c2. Essentially, you are subtracting one from cntc and adding one to cntc2. Obviously, you must choose c and c2 such that cntc>cnt2c and cntc2<cnt2c2. So, we only have to focus on c or c2 since one decreasing will automatically lead to the other increase. The answer is just the sum of cntcâˆ’cnt2c if cntc>cnt2c over all possible lowercase characters c. Code (C++)#include <bits/stdc++.h>
