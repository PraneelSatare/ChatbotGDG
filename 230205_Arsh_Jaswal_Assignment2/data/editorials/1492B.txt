1492B - Card DeckIt's easy to prove that order of a deck differs for different permutations. And more than that order of permutation a is greater than order of permutation b if and only if a is lexicographically greater than b.Since we need to build a lexicographic maximum permutation, at each point of time we need to choose such k that k-th element from the top of the original deck is the maximum element in this deck. Total complexity is O(nlogn) or O(n) (depending on the implementation).
