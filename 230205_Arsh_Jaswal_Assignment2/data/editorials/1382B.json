    "solution": "1382B - Sequential NimSuppose a1>1. If removing the entire first pile is winning, player 1 will do that. Otherwise, player 1 can leave exactly one stone in the first pile, forcing player 2 to remove it, leaving player 1 in the winning position. Otherwise, if a1=1, then it is forced to remove the first pile.So, whichever player gets the first pile with more than one stone wins. That is, let k be the maximum number such that a1=â‹¯=ak=1. If k is even, the first player will win. Otherwise, the second player will win. The only exception is when all piles have exactly 1 stone. In that case, the first player wins when k is odd.Complexity is O(n).Implementation"
