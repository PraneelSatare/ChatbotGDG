Problem Title: C. Uninteresting Number

time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes

You are given a number n with a length of no more than 105.
You can perform the following operation any number of times: choose one of its digits, square it, and replace the original digit with the result. The result must be a digit (that is, if you choose the digit x, then the value of x2 must be less than 10).
Is it possible to obtain a number that is divisible by 9 through these operations?
The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains the number n, without leading zeros. The length of the number does not exceed 105.
It is guaranteed that the sum of the lengths of the numbers across all test cases does not exceed 105.
For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to obtain a number divisible by 9 using the described operations, and "NO" otherwise.
You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive answer.
In the first example, from the integer 123, it is possible to obtain only 123, 143, 129, and 149, none of which are divisible by 9.
In the second example, you need to replace the second digit with its square; then n will equal 342=38⋅9.
In the third example, the integer is already divisible by 9.
