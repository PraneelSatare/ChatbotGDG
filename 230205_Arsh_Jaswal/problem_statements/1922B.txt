You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n. The length of the i-th stick is 2ai.
You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater than 0.
You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks does not matter (for example, choosing the 1-st, 2-nd and 4-th stick is the same as choosing the 2-nd, 4-th and 1-st stick). 
The first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines:
Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105.
For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.
In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can be chosen.
In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1-st, 2-nd and 4-th stick, or the 1-st, 3-rd and 4-th stick.
In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the given sticks with lengths 2, 4 and 8.
