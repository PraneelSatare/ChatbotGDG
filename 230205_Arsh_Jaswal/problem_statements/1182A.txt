time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes

You have a given integer n. Find the number of ways to fill all 3×n tiles with the shape described in the picture below. Upon filling, no empty spaces are allowed. Shapes cannot overlap.
The only line contains one integer n (1≤n≤60) — the length.
Print the number of ways to fill.
In the first example, there are 4 possible cases of filling.
