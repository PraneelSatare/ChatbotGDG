memory limit per test256 megabytes

Initially, you have the array a consisting of one element 1 (a=[1]).
In one move, you can do one of the following things:
For example, consider the sequence of five moves:
Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain the array with the sum at least n.
You have to answer t independent test cases.
The first line of the input contains one integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.
The only line of the test case contains one integer n (1≤n≤109) — the lower bound on the sum of the array.
For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of moves required to obtain the array with the sum at least n.
