time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes

You're given an array a of n integers, such that a1+a2+⋯+an=0.
In one operation, you can choose two different indices i and j (1≤i,j≤n), decrement ai by one and increment aj by one. If i<j this operation is free, otherwise it costs one coin.
How many coins do you have to spend in order to make all elements equal to 0?
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤5000). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1≤n≤105)  — the number of elements.
The next line contains n integers a1,…,an (−109≤ai≤109). It is given that ∑ni=1ai=0.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 105.
For each test case, print the minimum number of coins we have to spend in order to make all elements equal to 0.
Possible strategy for the first test case:
