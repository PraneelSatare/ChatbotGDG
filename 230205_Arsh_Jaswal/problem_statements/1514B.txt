Baby Badawy's first words were "AND 0 SUM BIG", so he decided to solve the following problem. Given two integers n and k, count the number of arrays of length n such that:
Since the answer can be very large, print its remainder when divided by 109+7.
The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤10) — the number of test cases you need to solve.
Each test case consists of a line containing two integers n and k (1≤n≤105, 1≤k≤20).
For each test case, print the number of arrays satisfying the conditions. Since the answer can be very large, print its remainder when divided by 109+7.
In the first example, the 4 arrays are:
