Problem Title: A. Nastia and Nearly Good Numbers

time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes

Nastia has 2 positive integers A and B. She defines that:
For example, if A=6 and B=4, the integers 24 and 72 are good, the integers 6, 660 and 12 are nearly good, the integers 16, 7 are neither good nor nearly good.
Find 3 different positive integers x, y, and z such that exactly one of them is good and the other 2 are nearly good, and x+y=z.
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤10000) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers A and B (1≤A≤106, 1≤B≤106) — numbers that Nastia has.
For each test case print: 
If there are multiple answers, print any.
In the first test case: 60 — good number; 10 and 50 — nearly good numbers.
In the second test case: 208 — good number; 169 and 39 — nearly good numbers.
In the third test case: 154 — good number; 28 and 182 — nearly good numbers.
