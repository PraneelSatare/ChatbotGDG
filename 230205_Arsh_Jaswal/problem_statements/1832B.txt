Problem Title: B. Maximum Sum

time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes

You are given an array a1,a2,…,an, where all elements are different.
You have to perform exactly k operations with it. During each operation, you do exactly one of the following two actions (you choose which to do yourself):
You have to calculate the maximum possible sum of elements in the resulting array.
The first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines: 
Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n does not exceed 2⋅105.
For each test case, print one integer — the maximum possible sum of elements in the resulting array.
In the first testcase, applying the first operation produces the following outcome: 
21 is the best answer.
In the second testcase, it's optimal to first erase two minimums, then a maximum.
