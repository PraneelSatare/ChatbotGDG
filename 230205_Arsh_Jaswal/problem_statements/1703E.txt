You are given a square grid with nn rows and nn columns. Each cell contains either 00 or 11. 
In an operation, you can select a cell of the grid and flip it (from 0→10→1 or 1→01→0). Find the minimum number of operations you need to obtain a square that remains the same when rotated 0∘0∘, 90∘90∘, 180∘180∘ and 270∘270∘.
The picture below shows an example of all rotations of a grid.
The first line contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤1001≤t≤100) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1≤n≤1001≤n≤100) — the size of the grid.
Then nn lines follow, each with nn characters ai,jai,j (0≤ai,j≤10≤ai,j≤1) — the number written in each cell.
For each test case output a single integer  — the minimum number of operations needed to make the square look the same rotated 0∘0∘, 90∘90∘, 180∘180∘ and 270∘270∘.
In the first test case, we can perform one operations to make the grid 010111010010111010. Now, all rotations of the square are the same.
In the second test case, all rotations of the square are already the same, so we don't need any flips.
