Problem Title: A. Nearest Minimums

time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes

You are given an array of n integer numbers a0, a1, ..., an - 1. Find the distance between two closest (nearest) minimums in it. It is guaranteed that in the array a minimum occurs at least two times.
The first line contains positive integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 105) — size of the given array. The second line contains n integers a0, a1, ..., an - 1 (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — elements of the array. It is guaranteed that in the array a minimum occurs at least two times.
Print the only number — distance between two nearest minimums in the array.
