Let's write all the positive integer numbers one after another from 11 without any delimiters (i.e. as a single string). It will be the infinite sequence starting with 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536...
Your task is to print the kk-th digit of this sequence.
The first and only line contains integer kk (1≤k≤100001≤k≤10000) — the position to process (11-based index).
Print the kk-th digit of the resulting infinite sequence.
