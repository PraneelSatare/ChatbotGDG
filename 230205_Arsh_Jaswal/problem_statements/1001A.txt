Problem Title: A. Generate plus state or minus state

time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes

You are given a qubit in state  and an integer sign. 
Your task is to convert the given qubit to state  if sign = 1 or  if sign =  - 1.
You have to implement an operation which takes a qubit and an integer as an input and has no output. The "output" of your solution is the state in which it left the input qubit.
Your code should have the following signature:
