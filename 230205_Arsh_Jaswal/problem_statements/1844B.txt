You are given a positive integer nn.
In this problem, the MEXMEX of a collection of integers c1,c2,…,ckc1,c2,…,ck is defined as the smallest positive integer xx which does not occur in the collection cc. 
The primality of an array a1,…,ana1,…,an is defined as the number of pairs (l,r)(l,r) such that 1≤l≤r≤n1≤l≤r≤n and MEX(al,…,ar)MEX(al,…,ar) is a prime number. 
Find any permutation of 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n with the maximum possible primality among all permutations of 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n. 
Note: 
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases tt (1≤t≤1041≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer nn (1≤n≤2⋅1051≤n≤2⋅105).
It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.
For each test case, output nn integers: a permutation of 1,2,…,n1,2,…,n that achieves the maximum possible primality.
If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.
In the first test case, there are 33 pairs (l,r)(l,r) with 1≤l≤r≤21≤l≤r≤2, out of which 22 have a prime MEX(al,…,ar)MEX(al,…,ar): 
In the second test case, MEX(1)=2MEX(1)=2 is prime, so the primality is 11.
In the third test case, the maximum possible primality is 88.
