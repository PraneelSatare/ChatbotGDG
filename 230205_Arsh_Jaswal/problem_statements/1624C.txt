Problem Title: C. Division by Two and Permutation

time limit per test3 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes

You are given an array aa consisting of nn positive integers. You can perform operations on it.
In one operation you can replace any element of the array aiai with ⌊ai2⌋⌊ai2⌋, that is, by an integer part of dividing aiai by 22 (rounding down).
See if you can apply the operation some number of times (possible 00) to make the array aa become a permutation of numbers from 11 to nn —that is, so that it contains all numbers from 11 to nn, each exactly once.
For example, if a=[1,8,25,2]a=[1,8,25,2], n=4n=4, then the answer is yes. You could do the following:
The first line of input data contains an integer tt (1≤t≤1041≤t≤104) —the number of test cases.
Each test case contains exactly two lines. The first one contains an integer nn (1≤n≤501≤n≤50), the second one contains integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1091≤ai≤109).
For each test case, output on a separate line:
You can output YES and NO in any case (for example, strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as a positive response).
The first test case is explained in the text of the problem statement.
In the second test case, it is not possible to get a permutation.
