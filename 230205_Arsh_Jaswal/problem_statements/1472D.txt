During their New Year holidays, Alice and Bob play the following game using an array a of n integers: 
If there are no numbers left in the array, then the game ends. The player with the highest score wins. If the scores of the players are equal, then a draw is declared.
For example, if n=4 and a=[5,2,7,3], then the game could go as follows (there are other options): 
You want to find out who will win if both players play optimally. Note that there may be duplicate numbers in the array.
The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of elements in the array a.
The next line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109) — the array a used to play the game.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.
For each test case, output on a separate line:
