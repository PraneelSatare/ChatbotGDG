time limit per test2.5 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes

Monocarp is playing a computer game. In order to level up his character, he can complete quests. There are n quests in the game, numbered from 1 to n.
Monocarp can complete quests according to the following rules: 
Note that Monocarp can complete the same quest multiple times.
For each completion, the character gets some amount of experience points: 
Monocarp is a very busy person, so he has free time to complete no more than k quests. Your task is to calculate the maximum possible total experience Monocarp can get if he can complete no more than k quests.
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1≤n≤2⋅105; 1≤k≤2⋅105) — the number of quests and the maximum number of quests Monocarp can complete, respectively.
The second line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤103).
The third line contains n integers b1,b2,…,bn (1≤bi≤103).
Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.
For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum possible total experience Monocarp can get if he can complete no more than k quests.
In the first test case, one of the possible quest completion sequences is as follows: 1,1,2,3,2,4,4; its total experience is equal to 4_+1+3_+1_+1+2_+1=13 (the underlined numbers correspond to the instances when we complete a quest for the first time).
In the second test case, one of the possible quest completion sequences is as follows: 1,1; its total experience is equal to 1_+3=4.
In the third test case, one of the possible quest completion sequences is as follows: 1,2,2,2,3; its total experience is equal to 3_+2_+3+3+4_=15.
