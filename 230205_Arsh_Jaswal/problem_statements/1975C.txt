Problem Title: C. Chamo and Mocha's Array

time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes

Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a consisting of n positive integers as a gift.
Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step operation some (possibly, zero) times: 
Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially: 
Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.
† The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies position number ⌊m+12⌋ after we sort the elements in non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the median of [5,25,20,24] is 20.
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤500). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2≤n≤105) — the length of the array a.
The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109) — the elements of the array a.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 105.
For each test case, output the maximum value of the number.
In the first test case, a=[1,2]. Mocha can only choose the interval (l,r)=(1,2). The array will be changed to a=[1,1]. Therefore, the answer is 1.
In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:
The array contains only the same number, which is 4. It can be proven that the maximum value of the final number cannot be greater than 4.
