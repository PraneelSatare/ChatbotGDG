Problem Title: B. Cat Cycle

time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes

Suppose you are living with two cats: A and B. There are n napping spots where both cats usually sleep.
Your cats like to sleep and also like all these spots, so they change napping spot each hour cyclically: 
The cat B is much younger, so they have a strict hierarchy: A and B don't lie together. In other words, if both cats'd like to go in spot x then the A takes this place and B moves to the next place in its order (if x<n then to x+1, but if x=n then to 1). Cat B follows his order, so it won't return to the skipped spot x after A frees it, but will move to the spot x+2 and so on.
Calculate, where cat B will be at hour k?
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2≤n≤109; 1≤k≤109) — the number of spots and hour k.
For each test case, print one integer — the index of the spot where cat B will sleep at hour k.
In the first and second test cases n=2, so: 
In the sixth test case:
