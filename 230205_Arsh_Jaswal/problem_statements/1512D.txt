Problem Title: D. Corrupted Array

time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes

You are given a number n and an array b1,b2,…,bn+2, obtained according to the following algorithm: 
For example, the array b=[2,3,7,12,2] it could be obtained in the following ways: 
For the given array b, find any array a that could have been guessed initially.
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104). Then t test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105).
The second row of each test case contains n+2 integers b1,b2,…,bn+2 (1≤bi≤109).
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.
For each test case, output: 
If there are several arrays of a, you can output any.
