Problem Title: B. GCD Length

time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes

You are given three integers a, b and c.
Find two positive integers x and y (x>0, y>0) such that: 
gcd(x,y) denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers x and y.
Output x and y. If there are multiple answers, output any of them.
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤285) — the number of testcases.
Each of the next t lines contains three integers a, b and c (1≤a,b≤9, 1≤c≤min(a,b)) — the required lengths of the numbers.
It can be shown that the answer exists for all testcases under the given constraints.
Additional constraint on the input: all testcases are different.
For each testcase print two positive integers — x and y (x>0, y>0) such that
