Problem Title: C. Two Teams Composing

time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes

You have n students under your control and you have to compose exactly two teams consisting of some subset of your students. Each student had his own skill, the i-th student skill is denoted by an integer ai (different students can have the same skills).
So, about the teams. Firstly, these two teams should have the same size. Two more constraints:
Note that it is permissible that some student of the first team has the same skill as a student of the second team.
Consider some examples (skills are given):
Your task is to find the maximum possible size x for which it is possible to compose a valid pair of teams, where each team size is x (skills in the first team needed to be unique, skills in the second team should be the same between them). A student cannot be part of more than one team.
You have to answer t independent test cases.
The first line of the input contains one integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.
The first line of the test case contains one integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — the number of students. The second line of the test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤n), where ai is the skill of the i-th student. Different students can have the same skills.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105 (∑n≤2⋅105).
For each test case, print the answer — the maximum possible size x for which it is possible to compose a valid pair of teams, where each team size is x.
In the first test case of the example, it is possible to construct two teams of size 3: the first team is [1,2,4] and the second team is [4,4,4]. Note, that there are some other ways to construct two valid teams of size 3.
