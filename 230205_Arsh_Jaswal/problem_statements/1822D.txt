Problem Title: D. Super-Permutation

time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes

A permutation is a sequence n integers, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once. For example, [1], [3,5,2,1,4], [1,3,2] are permutations, while [2,3,2], [4,3,1], [0] are not.
Given a permutation a, we construct an array b, where bi=(a1+a2+ … +ai)modn.
A permutation of numbers [a1,a2,…,an] is called a super-permutation if [b1+1,b2+1,…,bn+1] is also a permutation of length n.
Grisha became interested whether a super-permutation of length n exists. Help him solve this non-trivial problem. Output any super-permutation of length n, if it exists. Otherwise, output −1.
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line containing one integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of the desired permutation.
The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.
For each test case, output in a separate line:
If there are several suitable permutations, output any of them.
