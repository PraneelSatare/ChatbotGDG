Let's call a number a binary decimal if it is a positive integer and all digits in its decimal notation are either 0 or 1. For example, 1010111 is a binary decimal, while 10201 and 787788 are not.
Given a number n, you are asked whether or not it is possible to represent n as a product of some (not necessarily distinct) binary decimals.
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤5⋅104) — the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤105).
For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if n can be represented as a product of binary decimals, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.
You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yES", "yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).
The first five test cases can be represented as a product of binary decimals as follows:
