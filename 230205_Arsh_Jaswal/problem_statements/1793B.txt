Problem Title: B. Fedya and Array

time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes

For his birthday recently Fedya was given an array aa of nn integers arranged in a circle, For each pair of neighboring numbers (a1a1 and a2a2, a2a2 and a3a3, ……, an−1an−1 and anan, anan and a1a1) the absolute difference between them is equal to 11.
Let's call a local maximum an element, which is greater than both of its neighboring elements. Also call a local minimum an element, which is less than both of its neighboring elements. Note, that elements a1a1 and anan are neighboring elements.
Unfortunately, Fedya lost an array, but he remembered in it the sum of local maximums xx and the sum of local minimums yy.
Given xx and yy, help Fedya find any matching array of minimum length.
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases tt (1≤t≤10001≤t≤1000). Description of the test cases follows.
Each line of each test case contain two integers xx and yy (−109≤y<x≤109−109≤y<x≤109) — the sum of local maximums and the sum of local minimums, respectively.
For each test case, in the first line print one integer nn — the minimum length of matching arrays.
In the second line print nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (−109⩽ai⩽109−109⩽ai⩽109) — the array elements such that the the absolute difference between each pair of neighboring is equal to 11.
If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.
It is guaranteed that the sum of nn over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.
In the first test case, the local maximums are the numbers at 3,73,7 and 1010 positions, and the local minimums are the numbers at 1,61,6 and 88 positions. x=a3+a7+a10=2+0+1=3x=a3+a7+a10=2+0+1=3, y=a1+a6+a8=0+(−1)+(−1)=−2y=a1+a6+a8=0+(−1)+(−1)=−2.
In the second test case, the local maximums are the numbers at 22 and 1010 positions, and the local minimums are the numbers at 11 and 33 positions. x=a2+a10=−1+5=4x=a2+a10=−1+5=4, y=a1+a3=−2+(−2)=−4y=a1+a3=−2+(−2)=−4.
In the third test case, the local maximums are the numbers at 11 and 55 positions, and the local minimums are the numbers at 33 and 66 positions.
