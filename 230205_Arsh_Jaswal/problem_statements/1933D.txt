Given an array a1,a2,…,an, determine whether it is possible to rearrange its elements into b1,b2,…,bn, such that b1modb2mod…modbn≠0.
Here xmody denotes the remainder from dividing x by y. Also, the modulo operations are calculated from left to right. That is, xmodymodz=(xmody)modz. For example, 2024mod1000mod8=(2024mod1000)mod8=24mod8=0.
The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2≤n≤105).
The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109).
The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.
For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible, "NO" otherwise.
You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.
In the first test case, rearranging the array into b=[1,2,3,4,5,6] (doing nothing) would result in 1mod2mod3mod4mod5mod6=1. Hence it is possible to achieve the goal.
In the second test case, the array b must be equal to [3,3,3,3,3], which would result in 3mod3mod3mod3mod3=0. Hence it is impossible to achieve the goal.
In the third test case, rearranging the array into b=[3,2,2] would result in 3mod2mod2=1. Hence it is possible to achieve the goal.
