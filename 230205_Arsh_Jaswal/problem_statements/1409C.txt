Problem Title: C. Yet Another Array Restoration

time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes

We have a secret array. You don't know this array and you have to restore it. However, you know some facts about this array:
It can be proven that such an array always exists under the constraints given below.
Among all possible arrays that satisfy the given conditions, we ask you to restore one which has the minimum possible maximum element. In other words, you have to minimize max(a1,a2,…,an).
You have to answer t independent test cases.
The first line of the input contains one integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.
The only line of the test case contains three integers n, x and y (2≤n≤50; 1≤x<y≤50) — the length of the array and two elements that are present in the array, respectively.
For each test case, print the answer: n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109), where ai is the i-th element of the required array. If there are several answers, you can print any (it also means that the order of elements doesn't matter).
It can be proven that such an array always exists under the given constraints.
