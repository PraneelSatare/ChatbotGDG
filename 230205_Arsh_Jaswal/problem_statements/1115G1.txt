Problem Title: G1. AND oracle

time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes

Implement a quantum oracle on N qubits which implements the following function: f(→x)=x0∧x1∧⋯∧xN−1
You have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs:
and performs a transformation |x⟩|y⟩→|x⟩|y⊕f(x)⟩. The operation doesn't have an output; its "output" is the state in which it leaves the qubits.
Your code should have the following signature:
