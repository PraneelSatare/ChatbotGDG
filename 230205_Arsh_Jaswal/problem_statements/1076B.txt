Problem Title: B. Divisor Subtraction

time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes

You are given an integer number n. The following algorithm is applied to it:
Determine the number of subtrations the algorithm will make.
The only line contains a single integer n (2≤n≤1010).
Print a single integer — the number of subtractions the algorithm will make.
In the first example 5 is the smallest prime divisor, thus it gets subtracted right away to make a 0.
In the second example 2 is the smallest prime divisor at both steps.
