time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes

Implement a quantum oracle on N qubits which implements the following function: , where  (a vector of N integers, each of which can be 0 or 1).
For an explanation on how this type of quantum oracles works, see Introduction to quantum oracles.
You have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs:
The operation doesn't have an output; its "output" is the state in which it leaves the qubits.
Your code should have the following signature:
