time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes

There are n flowers in a row, the i-th of them initially has a positive height of hi meters.
Every second, the wind will blow from the left, causing the height of some flowers to decrease.
Specifically, every second, for each i from 1 to n, in this order, the following happens: 
How many seconds will pass before hi=0 for all 1≤i≤n for the first time?
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤105) — the number of flowers.
The second line of each test case contains n integers h1,h2,…,hn (1≤hi≤109) — the heights of the flowers.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 105.
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of seconds that will pass before hi=0 for all 1≤i≤n. 
In the first test case, the flower heights change as follows: [1,1,2]→[1,1,1]→[1,1,0]→[1,0,0]→[0,0,0].
In the second test case, the flower heights change as follows: [3,1]→[2,0]→[1,0]→[0,0].
