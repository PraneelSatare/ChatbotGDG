Problem Title: C. Turtle and Good Pairs

time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes

Turtle gives you a string s, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
Turtle considers a pair of integers (i,j) (1≤i<j≤n) to be a pleasant pair if and only if there exists an integer k such that i≤k<j and both of the following two conditions hold:
Besides, Turtle considers a pair of integers (i,j) (1≤i<j≤n) to be a good pair if and only if si=sj or (i,j) is a pleasant pair.
Turtle wants to reorder the string s so that the number of good pairs is maximized. Please help him!
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤104). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of the string.
The second line of each test case contains a string s of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.
For each test case, output the string s after reordering so that the number of good pairs is maximized. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
In the first test case, (1,3) is a good pair in the reordered string. It can be seen that we can't reorder the string so that the number of good pairs is greater than 1. bac and cab can also be the answer.
In the second test case, (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,4), (2,5), (3,5) are good pairs in the reordered string. efddd can also be the answer.
