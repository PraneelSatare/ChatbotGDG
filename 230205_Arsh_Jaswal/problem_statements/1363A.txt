Shubham has an array a of size n, and wants to select exactly x elements from it, such that their sum is odd. These elements do not have to be consecutive. The elements of the array are not guaranteed to be distinct.
Tell him whether he can do so.
The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1≤x≤n≤1000) — the length of the array and the number of elements you need to choose.
The next line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤1000) — elements of the array.
For each test case, print "Yes" or "No" depending on whether it is possible to choose x elements such that their sum is odd.
You may print every letter in any case you want.
For 1st case: We must select element 999, and the sum is odd.
For 2nd case: We must select element 1000, so overall sum is not odd.
For 3rd case: We can select element 51.
For 4th case: We must select both elements 50 and 51  — so overall sum is odd.
For 5th case: We must select all elements  — but overall sum is not odd.
