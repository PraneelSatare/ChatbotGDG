Problem Title: C. Yarik and Array

time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes

A subarray is a continuous part of array.
Yarik recently found an array a of n elements and became very interested in finding the maximum sum of a non empty subarray. However, Yarik doesn't like consecutive integers with the same parity, so the subarray he chooses must have alternating parities for adjacent elements.
For example, [1,2,3] is acceptable, but [1,2,4] is not, as 2 and 4 are both even and adjacent.
You need to help Yarik by finding the maximum sum of such a subarray.
The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤104) — number of test cases. Each test case is described as follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — length of the array.
The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (−103≤ai≤103) — elements of the array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.
For each test case, output a single integer — the answer to the problem.
