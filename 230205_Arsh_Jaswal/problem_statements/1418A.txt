You are playing a very popular game called Cubecraft. Initially, you have one stick and want to craft k torches. One torch can be crafted using one stick and one coal.
Hopefully, you've met a very handsome wandering trader who has two trade offers:
During one trade, you can use only one of these two trade offers. You can use each trade offer any number of times you want to, in any order.
Your task is to find the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least k torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.
You have to answer t independent test cases.
The first line of the input contains one integer t (1≤t≤2⋅104) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.
The only line of the test case contains three integers x, y and k (2≤x≤109; 1≤y,k≤109) — the number of sticks you can buy with one stick, the number of sticks required to buy one coal and the number of torches you need, respectively.
For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of trades you need to craft at least k torches. The answer always exists under the given constraints.
