Problem Title: A. Best Subsegment

time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes

You are given array a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an. Find the subsegment al,al+1,…,aral,al+1,…,ar (1≤l≤r≤n1≤l≤r≤n) with maximum arithmetic mean 1r−l+1r∑i=lai1r−l+1∑i=lrai (in floating-point numbers, i.e. without any rounding).
If there are many such subsegments find the longest one.
The first line contains single integer nn (1≤n≤1051≤n≤105) — length of the array aa.
The second line contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (0≤ai≤1090≤ai≤109) — the array aa.
Print the single integer — the length of the longest subsegment with maximum possible arithmetic mean.
The subsegment [3,4][3,4] is the longest among all subsegments with maximum arithmetic mean.
