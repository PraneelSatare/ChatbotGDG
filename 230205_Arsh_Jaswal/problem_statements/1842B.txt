Problem Title: B. Tenzing and Books

time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes

Tenzing received 3n3n books from his fans. The books are arranged in 33 stacks with nn books in each stack. Each book has a non-negative integer difficulty rating.
Tenzing wants to read some (possibly zero) books. At first, his knowledge is 00.
To read the books, Tenzing will choose a non-empty stack, read the book on the top of the stack, and then discard the book. If Tenzing's knowledge is currently uu, then his knowledge will become u|vu|v after reading a book with difficulty rating vv. Here || denotes the bitwise OR operation. Note that Tenzing can stop reading books whenever he wants.
Tenzing's favourite number is xx. Can you help Tenzing check if it is possible for his knowledge to become xx?
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer tt (1≤t≤1041≤t≤104) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers nn and xx (1≤n≤1051≤n≤105, 0≤x≤1090≤x≤109) — the number of books in each stack and Tenzing's favourite number.
The second line of each test case contains nn integers a1,a2,…,ana1,a2,…,an (0≤ai≤1090≤ai≤109)  — the difficulty rating of the books in the first stack, from top to bottom.
The third line of each test case contains nn integers b1,b2,…,bnb1,b2,…,bn (0≤bi≤1090≤bi≤109)  — the difficulty rating of the books in the second stack, from top to bottom.
The fourth line of each test case contains nn integers c1,c2,…,cnc1,c2,…,cn (0≤ci≤1090≤ci≤109)  — the difficulty rating of the books in the third stack, from top to bottom.
It is guaranteed that the sum of nn does not exceed 105105.
For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Tenzing can make his knowledge equal to xx, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.
You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.
For the first test case, Tenzing can read the following 44 books: 
After reading all books, Tenzing's knowledge is 77.
For the third test case, Tenzing can read 00 books to make his final knowledge equals to 00.
