Problem Title: C. Sort Zero

time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes

You are given an array of n positive integers a1,a2,…,an. 
In one operation you do the following: 
Find the minimum number of operations required to sort the array in non-decreasing order.
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1≤t≤104). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤105).
The second line of each test case contains n positive integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤n).
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 105.
For each test case print one integer — the minimum number of operations required to sort the array in non-decreasing order.
In the first test case, you can choose x=3 for the operation, the resulting array is [0,0,2].
In the second test case, you can choose x=1 for the first operation and x=3 for the second operation, the resulting array is [0,0,0,0].
