Problem Title: A. Game 23

time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes

Polycarp plays "Game 23". Initially he has a number n and his goal is to transform it to m. In one move, he can multiply n by 2 or multiply n by 3. He can perform any number of moves.
Print the number of moves needed to transform n to m. Print -1 if it is impossible to do so.
It is easy to prove that any way to transform n to m contains the same number of moves (i.e. number of moves doesn't depend on the way of transformation).
The only line of the input contains two integers n and m (1≤n≤m≤5⋅108).
Print the number of moves to transform n to m, or -1 if there is no solution.
In the first example, the possible sequence of moves is: 120→240→720→1440→4320→12960→25920→51840. The are 7 steps in total.
In the second example, no moves are needed. Thus, the answer is 0.
In the third example, it is impossible to transform 48 to 72.
