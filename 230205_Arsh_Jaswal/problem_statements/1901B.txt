Problem Title: B. Chip and Ribbon

time limit per test2 seconds
memory limit per test256 megabytes

There is a ribbon divided into nn cells, numbered from 11 to nn from left to right. Initially, an integer 00 is written in each cell.
Monocarp plays a game with a chip. The game consists of several turns. During the first turn, Monocarp places the chip in the 11-st cell of the ribbon. During each turn except for the first turn, Monocarp does exactly one of the two following actions:
At the end of each turn, the integer written in the cell with the chip is increased by 11.
Monocarp's goal is to make some turns so that the 11-st cell contains the integer c1c1, the 22-nd cell contains the integer c2c2, ..., the nn-th cell contains the integer cncn. He wants to teleport the chip as few times as possible.
Help Monocarp calculate the minimum number of times he has to teleport the chip. 
The first line contains one integer tt (1≤t≤1041≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines: 
It can be shown that under these constraints, it is always possible to make a finite amount of turns so that the integers in the cells match the sequence c1,c2,…,cnc1,c2,…,cn.
Additional constraint on the input: the sum of values of nn over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅1052⋅105.
For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of times Monocarp has to teleport the chip.
In the first test case of the example, Monocarp can perform the turns as follows:
