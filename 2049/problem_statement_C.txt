Problem Statement

Evirir the dragon has many friends. They have 3 friends! That is one more than the average dragon.
You are given integers n , x , and y . There are n dragons sitting in a circle. The dragons are numbered 1,2,…,n . For each i ( 1≤i≤n ), dragon i is friends with dragon i−1 and i+1 , where dragon 0 is defined to be dragon n and dragon n+1 is defined to be dragon 1 . Additionally, dragons x and y are friends with each other (if they are already friends, this changes nothing). Note that all friendships are mutual.
Output n non-negative integers a 1 , a 2 ,…, a n such that for each dragon i ( 1≤i≤n ), the following holds:
- Let f 1 , f 2 ,…, f k be the friends of dragon i . Then a i =mex( a f 1 , a f 2 ,…, a f k ) . ∗
∗ The minimum excluded (MEX) of a collection of integers c 1 , c 2 ,…, c m is defined as the smallest non-negative integer t which does not occur in the collection c .

Footnote
∗ The minimum excluded (MEX) of a collection of integers c 1 , c 2 ,…, c m is defined as the smallest non-negative integer t which does not occur in the collection c .

Input
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t ( 1≤t≤ 10 4 ). The description of the test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , x , y ( 3≤n≤2⋅ 10 5 , 1≤x<y≤n ).
It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅ 10 5 .

Output
Output
For each test case, output n space-separated non-negative integers a 1 , a 2 ,…, a n ( 0≤ a i ≤ 10 9 ) on a line that satisfy the condition in the statement. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. It can be proven that under the problem constraints, a solution with 0≤ a i ≤ 10 9 always exists.

Example
[{'input': ['5 1 3'], 'output': '0'}, {'input': ['4 2 4'], 'output': '2'}, {'input': ['6 3 5'], 'output': '1'}, {'input': ['7 3 6'], 'output': '0'}, {'input': ['3 2 3'], 'output': '1'}, {'input': ['5 1 5'], 'output': '1'}, {'input': ['6 2 5'], 'output': '2'}]

Note
Note
For the first test case:
- i=1 : Dragon 1 's friends are dragons 2,3,5 . mex( a 2 , a 3 , a 5 )=mex(2,1,1)=0= a 1 , so the condition for dragon 1 is satisfied.
- i=2 : Dragon 2 's friends are dragons 1,3 . mex( a 1 , a 3 )=mex(0,1)=2= a 2 .
- i=3 : Dragon 3 's friends are dragons 1,2,4 . mex( a 1 , a 2 , a 4 )=mex(0,2,0)=1= a 3 .
- i=4 : Dragon 4 's friends are dragons 3,5 . mex( a 3 , a 5 )=mex(1,1)=0= a 4 .
- i=5 : Dragon 5 's friends are dragons 1,4 . mex( a 1 , a 4 )=mex(0,0)=1= a 5 .
